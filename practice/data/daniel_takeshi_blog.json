This was the first in-person RSS after two virtual editions in 2020 and 2021. I don’t publish in RSS frequently. I only have one RSS paper, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09044\">VisuoSpatial Foresight</a>, from 2020. I was attending mainly because of its nearby location in New York City and because I was invited to attend <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2022/\">RSS Pioneers</a>, which is a unique event arranged by this conference.</p>\n\n<p>I’m well aware that this report, <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2022/08/03/icra-2022/\">like the one I wrote for ICRA 2022</a>, is coming well after the conference has ended. Things have been extremely busy on my end but I will try and improve the turnaround time between attending and reporting about a conference.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rss-2022-pioneers\">RSS 2022: Pioneers</h2>\n\n<p>For the first day, I arrived on campus for RSS Pioneers, which happened the day before the “official” RSS conference. <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2022/\">To quote from the website</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>RSS Pioneers is an intensive workshop for senior Ph.D. students and early career researchers in the robotics community. Held in conjunction with the main Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, each year the RSS Pioneers brings together a cohort of the world’s top early-career researchers. The workshop aims to provide these promising researchers with networking opportunities and help to navigate their next career stages, and foster creativity and collaboration surrounding challenges in all areas of robotics. The workshop will include a mix of research and career talks from senior scholars in the field from both academia and industry, research presentations from attendees and networking activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I arrived early as usual to meet the sign language interpreters, which I had requested well in advance. (Columbia University paid the bill since they were hosting the conference.) We had some minor hiccups at the start when the security guards wouldn’t let the interpreters inside with  me. Columbia Mechanical Engineering professor Matei Ciocarlie was the local arrangements chair of RSS and thus in charge of much of the day-to-day affairs, and he kept trying to explain to the security guards why there were there and why we all had to be allowed inside. Eventually he convinced the security guards, and I arrived just in the nick of time.</p>\n\n<p>During RSS Pioneers, the 30 or so “Pioneers” gave brief presentations of our research. I presented my recent theme of robot learning for deformable manipulation. There were also talks from professors, which for Pioneers was an interesting mix of both technical talks and high-level thoughts. Some of the “high-level” aspects of the talks included de-emphasizing rankings of the school, the different research cultures of the United States and Europe, how (not) to compare one’s research with others, and dealing with publish-or-perish. Throughout the day, we had brief social breaks, and ultimately, the real value of this event is probably that we get to know other Pioneers and increase our connections with the robotics field. Personally, it took me a while to view myself as a roboticist. Overall I’m happy I attended this year’s edition.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rss-2022-the-conference\">RSS 2022: The Conference</h2>\n\n<p>The actual conference and “conference workshops” (hereafter, just “workshops”) started the next day, with the first and fifth days for workshops. An interesting workshop I attended was about “Overlooked Aspects on Imitation Learning.” In general, as per my rule for attending these events, I tried not to get bogged down by attending <em>every</em> talk in a workshop, and instead I spent some time in a common room area where they had food and snacks, to see if other attendees were available for impromptu chats.</p>\n\n<p>In between the two workshop days, the conference had the usual set of keynotes and paper presentations. A lot of the interesting papers to me were ones that I already knew of in advance (thanks to arXiv, Twitter, and the like) such as <a href=\"https://dextairity.cs.columbia.edu/\">DextAIRity</a>, <a href=\"https://irp.cs.columbia.edu/\">Iterative Residual Policy</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07813\">Autonomously Untangling Long Cables</a>, all three of which garnered awards (or were finalists for them). An interesting paper which I did <em>not</em> know about in advance was <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12716\">You Only Demonstrate Once</a>. From a technical perspective, I think it’s a very nice systems paper which combines a variety of techniques: using specialized objects coordinate spaces (called “NUNOCS” in the paper), a motion tracker, category-level behavioral cloning, etc. I should also give a shout-out to the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/articulated-flowbot-3d/home\">FlowBot3D</a> paper from our lab, which was one of the best paper finalists. I am not an author, but my <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09006\">ToolFlowNet</a> paper for the upcoming Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) builds upon FlowBot3D with similar ideas.</p>\n\n<p>A unfortunate thing is that, as with ICRA earlier this year, we continually ran into technical problems with speakers unable to reliably connect their laptops to the projectors. In one particularly unfortunate oral presentation, the projector strangely turned off, then on, at regular intervals. I counted an interval time of about 10 seconds where, without fail, the projector would turn off and on, almost perfectly on cue! I felt very sorry for the speaker. Is there any way that we can improve the state of affairs for connecting to projectors? It seems to be a universal problem.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to talks, poster sessions, and coffee break chats, since RSS was at Columbia University. I was fortunate to get a semi-private tour of the Columbia robotics lab. I saw <a href=\"https://flingbot.cs.columbia.edu/\">FlingBot</a> and <a href=\"https://dextairity.cs.columbia.edu/\">DextAIRity</a> in action. I thank the members of Shuran Song’s lab who gave me this tour. Having a set of coordinating UR5 arms in one setup has been great for their research acceleration.</p>\n\n<p>RSS does not provide lunch or dinner for each day, but as is typical in academic conferences in my circle, one of the nights is dedicated to a “fancy” dinner event. For this year’s edition, RSS had dinner on a cruise ship which took us around lower Manhattan. The food was incredibly delicious and diverse, and perhaps the best I have eaten at a conference – there were salads, vegetarian dishes, fish, chicken, fancy desserts, and a bunch of stuff I can’t recall. Obviously this service doesn’t come cheap. I heard it’s about 150 USD per person. Aided by the interpreter who did a tremendous job in the noisy context, I had a bunch of intellectually stimulating conversations which I recall included robotics (obviously), politics (should the US military fund robotics research), and my future job plans (one can only be a postdoc for so long).</p>\n\n<p>The conference also had a town hall, to solicit feedback from us. This is a good thing, and I appreciate RSS for doing this. Some of the questions had to do with the nature of what a “systems” paper means. Other questions had to do with reducing stress on students and researchers. One of the paper awards for RSS is a “<a href=\"https://www.roboticsfoundation.org/awards/best-systems-paper-in-memory-of-seth-teller/\">Best systems paper award in honor of Seth Teller</a>.” Seth Teller was <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1927\">a professor at MIT and passed away in 2014 from suicide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From the closing ceremonies, we learned that RSS 2023 will be in Daegu, South Korea next year, which is the first time it’s being held in Asia. This is a good thing for the sake of balance, given the recent US-heavy tilt on conferences. It will pose some issues for me if I were to request sign language interpreters, but I am OK with balancing the location of conferences since we need to consider the full community’s needs (not just mine) when picking locations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rss-2022-overall-impressions\">RSS 2022: Overall Impressions</h2>\n\n<p>I was fortunate to attend RSS in person for the first time in my career. The conference is much smaller compared to ICRA and IROS and is single-track, which meant I did not feel overwhelmed with competing priorities. I exceeded my expectations in meeting people and understanding the work they do. Certainly, being part of RSS Pioneers helped, and I would recommend this to senior PhD students and postdocs.</p>\n\n<p>Columbia University’s in a fantastic location in New York City which makes travel to and from it easier. The subway system made transportation <em>within</em> the city easier, and there’s a lot of food nearby with a range of prices, not to mention attractions and museums. (Alas, I wish I had the time to spend a few extra days in NYC to explore it more…) The location also meant that, as is typically the case in big American cities, securing sign language interpreters generally isn’t too difficult. Of course, there are some inevitable challenges with space that come with NYC, and we might have seen that with the poster sessions at RSS, since they were in narrow ramps and stairs in one building. In contrast, ICRA 2022 in Philadelphia was not at the University of Pennsylvania campus but at the <em>Pennsylvania Convention Center</em> with massive space.</p>\n\n<p>RSS has some differences in terms of paper structure and reviewing as compared to ICRA and IROS. At RSS, there’s a longer page limit requirement, and since page limits in practice serve as <em>lower</em> bounds (since no one wants to be viewed as lacking content) that means papers have more material. At RSS there’s a slightly stricter acceptance rate and a more involved reviewing process (often with rebuttals) compared to other conferences. However, I’m well aware that this is subject to enormous variance in paper quality. But my point is: RSS papers tend to be high quality so if I see that a paper was presented there, it already hits some minimum quality threshold for me.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the content, RSS is becoming increasingly similar to the [Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL)]. A <em>lot</em> of RSS papers use machine learning. Matei Ciocarlie, the local arrangements chair, seems to have a similar interpretation and said to me: “oh, they [the RSS workshops] were all in robot learning …” A lot of RSS and CoRL papers could be interchangeable, in that papers accepted to RSS, assuming they have <em>some</em> robot learning aspect, could be accepted at CoRL and possibly vice versa. I have frequently seen cases when researchers submit papers to RSS, get rejected, improve the paper (to varying extents…), and get the paper accepted to CoRL. The reverse isn’t generally true since CoRL rejections tend to go to the following ICRA due to the timing.</p>\n\n<p>Given its full name as <em>Robotics: Science and Systems</em>, this <em>might</em> mean RSS papers have more of a physical robotics “system” aspect as compared to CoRL, though I am not sure if this applies in practice. UIUC Professor Kris Hauser chaired this edition’s conference and he <a href=\"https://hauser-kris.medium.com/an-open-letter-from-the-program-chair-of-robotics-science-and-systems-2022-419138fda27d\">wrote this Medium article</a> on what it means to write a systems-related robotics paper. Whether the community follows through on this is another matter, and there were some questions about the “systems” aspect research in the RSS town hall.</p>\n\n<p>In sum, to those who helped organize this year’s RSS conference, thank you very much!! I feel very fortunate to have attended and I hope to do so again in future editions.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, regarding CoRL, that conference is happening in a few days in Auckland, New Zealand. If you are attending, I will also be there and am happy to chat …</p>",

This was the first in-person RSS after two virtual editions in 2020 and 2021. I don’t publish in RSS frequently. I only have one RSS paper, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09044\">VisuoSpatial Foresight</a>, from 2020. I was attending mainly because of its nearby location in New York City and because I was invited to attend <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2022/\">RSS Pioneers</a>, which is a unique event arranged by this conference.</p>\n\n<p>I’m well aware that this report, <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2022/08/03/icra-2022/\">like the one I wrote for ICRA 2022</a>, is coming well after the conference has ended. Things have been extremely busy on my end but I will try and improve the turnaround time between attending and reporting about a conference.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rss-2022-pioneers\">RSS 2022: Pioneers</h2>\n\n<p>For the first day, I arrived on campus for RSS Pioneers, which happened the day before the “official” RSS conference. <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2022/\">To quote from the website</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>RSS Pioneers is an intensive workshop for senior Ph.D. students and early career researchers in the robotics community. Held in conjunction with the main Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference, each year the RSS Pioneers brings together a cohort of the world’s top early-career researchers. The workshop aims to provide these promising researchers with networking opportunities and help to navigate their next career stages, and foster creativity and collaboration surrounding challenges in all areas of robotics. The workshop will include a mix of research and career talks from senior scholars in the field from both academia and industry, research presentations from attendees and networking activities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I arrived early as usual to meet the sign language interpreters, which I had requested well in advance. (Columbia University paid the bill since they were hosting the conference.) We had some minor hiccups at the start when the security guards wouldn’t let the interpreters inside with  me. Columbia Mechanical Engineering professor Matei Ciocarlie was the local arrangements chair of RSS and thus in charge of much of the day-to-day affairs, and he kept trying to explain to the security guards why there were there and why we all had to be allowed inside. Eventually he convinced the security guards, and I arrived just in the nick of time.</p>\n\n<p>During RSS Pioneers, the 30 or so “Pioneers” gave brief presentations of our research. I presented my recent theme of robot learning for deformable manipulation. There were also talks from professors, which for Pioneers was an interesting mix of both technical talks and high-level thoughts. Some of the “high-level” aspects of the talks included de-emphasizing rankings of the school, the different research cultures of the United States and Europe, how (not) to compare one’s research with others, and dealing with publish-or-perish. Throughout the day, we had brief social breaks, and ultimately, the real value of this event is probably that we get to know other Pioneers and increase our connections with the robotics field. Personally, it took me a while to view myself as a roboticist. Overall I’m happy I attended this year’s edition.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rss-2022-the-conference\">RSS 2022: The Conference</h2>\n\n<p>The actual conference and “conference workshops” (hereafter, just “workshops”) started the next day, with the first and fifth days for workshops.

This is the \"Grand Hall\"\narea where we had the conference reception. There are a lot of (more\nprofessional) photos on the conference website.\n</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>At long last, after more than two years of virtual conferences, last May I\nattended an <em>in-person</em> conference, the 2022 International Conference on\nRobotics and Automation (ICRA), from May 23-27. The last in-person conferences\nI attended were ISRR 2019 in Hanoi, Vietnam and NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver,\nCanada (blog posts are <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/10/13/isrr-day-01/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/12/22/neurips/\">here</a>).  Apologies for the massive\nmonths-long delay in blogging. One challenge with ICRA’s timing is that it was\nfew weeks before the CoRL 2022 deadline, and so I (and many other attendees, as\nI would soon learn) were busy trying to work on our paper submissions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background-and-context\">Background and Context</h2>\n\n<p>ICRA is a large conference, held annually since 1984. You can find <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra/past-and-future-venues\">the list of\npast and future venues here</a>. The last full in-person ICRA was <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/06/02/icra/\">in 2019 in\nMontreal, Canada</a>. This year, it was in Philadelphia in a former train\nstation converted to a large conference convention center. Philadelphia (or\n“Philly” as it’s often referred to in informal parlance) is also important in\nthe political development of the United States and near the convention center\nare relevant museums and historical landmarks such as the Liberty Bell.</p>\n\n<p>As with many other 5-day academic conferences and consistent with prior ICRAs,\ntwo are for workshops and three are for the main conference.  Fortunately, I\nwas able to attend the entire thing, plus stay an extra day after ICRA to\nexplore Philly; call it a one-day vacation if you like.</p>\n\n<p>I went to ICRA for several reasons. First, I wanted to return to an in-person\nconference experience. Second, it’s close: I work at CMU now, which is in the\nsame state of Pennsylvania (albeit on the opposite side) so the travel isn’t\ntoo bad. Third, for the first time in my research career, I was a co-organizer\nof a workshop. Fourth, I also had a paper accepted which we called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04814\">Planar\nRobot Casting</a>, led by outstanding undergraduate researcher Vincent Lim and\nPhD student Huang (Raven) Huang. Yes, in case you’re wondering, we deliberately\nchose the PRC acronym because it matches the People’s Republic of China.</p>\n\n<p>Another positive aspect of ICRA for me in particular is that ICRA and other\nIEEE conferences now have a new policy that explicitly allocates funding for\ncompliance with the Americans for Disabilities Act (ADA). In 2020, my PhD\nadvisors and I began asking the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) to\nencourage them to provide funding for academic accommodations for all\nRAS-sponsored conference. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_Goldberg/status/1404209273349963779\">Here’s a mid-2021 tweet by my PhD advisor Ken\nGoldberg</a> summarizing what happened. Though he mentions me in his tweet,\nthe real credit here goes to him and Torsten Kröger, and I thank both of them\nfor their support. In the past, I would arrange for such academic\naccommodations to the conference by asking my university, but having the\nconference pay is probably the more appropriate outcome. Furthermore, while the\nimpetus of this was my specific accommodation need, I hope this will extend for\nother accommodations.</p>\n\n<p>I emailed ICRA a few months before the conference to get them to arrange for\nsign language interpreters. Rule of thumb: the process <em>always</em> takes longer\nthan expected, so start early! After a long list of back-and-forth emails, ICRA\nwas able to arrange for the services and it turned out quite well. Certainly,\nhaving the conference located in the United States was another plus.  We’ll see\nif the process works out similarly well for ICRA 2023 in London, UK or ICRA\n2024 in Yokohama, Japan. Hopefully the same staff members will be involved, as\nthat might simplify the process considerably.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-experience\">My Experience</h2>\n\n<p>On the first day, I arrived early to the convention center. The first reason\nwas to meet the sign language interpreters, who often arrive early for such\nevents. For me, it’s critical to also get there early so I can introduce myself\nto them.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason for my early arrival was that I was one of the three lead\nco-organizers for the <a href=\"https://deformable-workshop.github.io/icra2022/\">2nd Workshop on Deformable Object Manipulation</a>,\nalong with Martina Lippi and Michael Welle. Those two were among the lead\norganizers last year and kindly invited me to help co-organize this year’s\nedition. Michael and I handled the in-person logistics for the workshop while\nMartina (in Italy) did a tremendous job holding the fort for all the remote\nneeds.</p>\n\n<p>We had a bit of a tight start to the workshop, because for some reason, either\nour room or our workshop was not properly registered with the conference and\nthus we didn’t have a microphone, a video projector, and other ingredients.\nMichael was able to hastily arrange for the conference staff to get the\nmaterials in time, but it was close. We also had issues with the microphone and\naudio in the morning and had to ask the convention staff to check. Other than\nthe initial hiccups, I though the workshop went well. We had high attendance,\nespecially for a workshop that was on the far end of the conference center. I’m\nguessing we regularly had 100 people in the room throughout the day (the exact\nnumber varied since people came in and out all the time). I met a lot of the\nauthors and attendees, and I hope they all enjoyed the workshop as much as I\nenjoyed co-hosting and co-organizing it.</p>\n\n<p>It was a nice experience, and I would be happy to organize a workshop again in\nthe near future. I would write another blog post on “lessons learned” but this\nis still just my first time organizing so I don’t want to make any\nnon-generalizable claims, and <a href=\"https://rowanmcallister.github.io/post/workshops/\">Rowan McAllister has already written a nice\nguide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Later, we had the conference welcome reception in a larger space, where we\ncould stand and grab food and drinks from various stalls. As usual, some of the\nfood was distinctively local. We had Philadelphia-themed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesesteak\">cheesesteaks</a>\nwhich I tried and thought were good.  These aren’t things I would normally eat,\nbut it’s good to experience this once in my life. In fact I didn’t even realize\nPhilly was known for cheesesteaks before coming to ICRA.</p>\n\n<p>Then we had the next three conference days. I spent the mornings attending the\nmajor talks, and then the rest of the days doing my best to talk with as many\npeople and groups as possible. Fortunately, it was much easier than I expected\nto snag impromptu conversations.

I also would later learn that other\nconference attendees were doing something similar as me.

When I look back at all the\nacademic conferences that I have attended in my career, I clearly had <em>the best\nnetworking experience I ever had at a conference</em>.

In\nterms of the things that could be interpreted as negatives, a few come to mind:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>For our workshop, we had some technical problems, such as our room being the\nonly workshop room not initially assigned a video projector system as\nmentioned earlier. We also had the inevitable audio and microphone issues,\nand multiple attendees told us that they couldn’t hear speakers well. Also as\nexpected, the hybrid format with online versus in-person attendees posed\nissues in that online speakers could often not hear speakers in the physical\nroom. To clarify, besides the fact that our workshop and/or room didn’t seem\nto be properly registered at first, all these issues have been common in\nother conferences.

This is the \"Grand Hall\"\narea where we had the conference reception. There are a lot of (more\nprofessional) photos on the conference website.\n</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>At long last, after more than two years of virtual conferences, last May I\nattended an <em>in-person</em> conference, the 2022 International Conference on\nRobotics and Automation (ICRA), from May 23-27. The last in-person conferences\nI attended were ISRR 2019 in Hanoi, Vietnam and NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver,\nCanada (blog posts are <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/10/13/isrr-day-01/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/12/22/neurips/\">here</a>).  Apologies for the massive\nmonths-long delay in blogging. One challenge with ICRA’s timing is that it was\nfew weeks before the CoRL 2022 deadline, and so I (and many other attendees, as\nI would soon learn) were busy trying to work on our paper submissions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"background-and-context\">Background and Context</h2>\n\n<p>ICRA is a large conference, held annually since 1984. You can find <a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra/past-and-future-venues\">the list of\npast and future venues here</a>. The last full in-person ICRA was <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/06/02/icra/\">in 2019 in\nMontreal, Canada</a>. This year, it was in Philadelphia in a former train\nstation converted to a large conference convention center. Philadelphia (or\n“Philly” as it’s often referred to in informal parlance) is also important in\nthe political development of the United States and near the convention center\nare relevant museums and historical landmarks such as the Liberty Bell.</p>\n\n<p>As with many other 5-day academic conferences and consistent with prior ICRAs,\ntwo are for workshops and three are for the main conference.  Fortunately, I\nwas able to attend the entire thing, plus stay an extra day after ICRA to\nexplore Philly; call it a one-day vacation if you like.</p>\n\n<p>I went to ICRA for several reasons. First, I wanted to return to an in-person\nconference experience. Second, it’s close: I work at CMU now, which is in the\nsame state of Pennsylvania (albeit on the opposite side) so the travel isn’t\ntoo bad. Third, for the first time in my research career, I was a co-organizer\nof a workshop. Fourth, I also had a paper accepted which we called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04814\">Planar\nRobot Casting</a>, led by outstanding undergraduate researcher Vincent Lim and\nPhD student Huang (Raven) Huang. Yes, in case you’re wondering, we deliberately\nchose the PRC acronym because it matches the People’s Republic of China.</p>\n\n<p>Another positive aspect of ICRA for me in particular is that ICRA and other\nIEEE conferences now have a new policy that explicitly allocates funding for\ncompliance with the Americans for Disabilities Act (ADA). In 2020, my PhD\nadvisors and I began asking the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) to\nencourage them to provide funding for academic accommodations for all\nRAS-sponsored conference. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ken_Goldberg/status/1404209273349963779\">Here’s a mid-2021 tweet by my PhD advisor Ken\nGoldberg</a> summarizing what happened. Though he mentions me in his tweet,\nthe real credit here goes to him and Torsten Kröger, and I thank both of them\nfor their support. In the past, I would arrange for such academic\naccommodations to the conference by asking my university, but having the\nconference pay is probably the more appropriate outcome. Furthermore, while the\nimpetus of this was my specific accommodation need, I hope this will extend for\nother accommodations.</p>\n\n<p>I emailed ICRA a few months before the conference to get them to arrange for\nsign language interpreters. Rule of thumb: the process <em>always</em> takes longer\nthan expected, so start early! After a long list of back-and-forth emails, ICRA\nwas able to arrange for the services and it turned out quite well. Certainly,\nhaving the conference located in the United States was another plus.  We’ll see\nif the process works out similarly well for ICRA 2023 in London, UK or ICRA\n2024 in Yokohama, Japan. Hopefully the same staff members will be involved, as\nthat might simplify the process considerably.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-experience\">My Experience</h2>\n\n<p>On the first day, I arrived early to the convention center. The first reason\nwas to meet the sign language interpreters, who often arrive early for such\nevents. For me, it’s critical to also get there early so I can introduce myself\nto them.</p>\n\n<p>The other reason for my early arrival was that I was one of the three lead\nco-organizers for the <a href=\"https://deformable-workshop.github.io/icra2022/\">2nd Workshop on Deformable Object Manipulation</a>,\nalong with Martina Lippi and Michael Welle. Those two were among the lead\norganizers last year and kindly invited me to help co-organize this year’s\nedition. Michael and I handled the in-person logistics for the workshop while\nMartina (in Italy) did a tremendous job holding the fort for all the remote\nneeds.</p>\n\n<p>We had a bit of a tight start to the workshop, because for some reason, either\nour room or our workshop was not properly registered with the conference and\nthus we didn’t have a microphone, a video projector, and other ingredients.\nMichael was able to hastily arrange for the conference staff to get the\nmaterials in time, but it was close. We also had issues with the microphone and\naudio in the morning and had to ask the convention staff to check. Other than\nthe initial hiccups, I though the workshop went well. We had high attendance,\nespecially for a workshop that was on the far end of the conference center. I’m\nguessing we regularly had 100 people in the room throughout the day (the exact\nnumber varied since people came in and out all the time). I met a lot of the\nauthors and attendees, and I hope they all enjoyed the workshop as much as I\nenjoyed co-hosting and co-organizing it.</p>\n\n<p>It was a nice experience, and I would be happy to organize a workshop again in\nthe near future. I would write another blog post on “lessons learned” but this\nis still just my first time organizing so I don’t want to make any\nnon-generalizable claims, and <a href=\"https://rowanmcallister.github.io/post/workshops/\">Rowan McAllister has already written a nice\nguide</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Later, we had the conference welcome reception in a larger space, where we\ncould stand and grab food and drinks from various stalls. As usual, some of the\nfood was distinctively local. We had Philadelphia-themed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesesteak\">cheesesteaks</a>\nwhich I tried and thought were good.  These aren’t things I would normally eat,\nbut it’s good to experience this once in my life. In fact I didn’t even realize\nPhilly was known for cheesesteaks before coming to ICRA.</p>\n\n<p>Then we had the next three conference days. I spent the mornings attending the\nmajor talks, and then the rest of the days doing my best to talk with as many\npeople and groups as possible. Fortunately, it was much easier than I expected\nto snag impromptu conversations. I made a few “semi-formal” plans by emailing\npeople to ask for meeting times, but for the most part, my interactions were\nhighly random. I’m not sure if that’s the case for most people who attended the\nconference?</p>\n\n<p>I tried to set my time so that my first priority was to talk with people.

      "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<img src=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/assets/robo_manip/system_iros2022.png\" width=\"\" />\n<br />\n<i>\nThe system for our IROS 2022 paper on singulating layers of cloth with tactile sensing.\n</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>In collaboration with my colleagues at Berkeley and CMU, we recently uploaded\ntwo papers to arXiv on robotic fabric manipulation:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08921\">Efficiently Learning Single-Arm Fling Motions to Smooth Garments</a>, for <a href=\"https://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/ISRR2022/\">ISRR 2022</a>.</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11196\">Learning to Singulate Layers of Cloth using Tactile Feedback</a>, for <a href=\"https://iros2022.org/\">IROS 2022</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Robotic fabric (or cloth) manipulation is a recurring theme in my research, and\nthese two papers continue the trend. The first paper, which we started a while\nback in Spring 2021, is about <em>dynamic</em> fabric manipulation; it can be thought\nof as an extension of our earlier ICRA papers on “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04840\">Robots of the Lost Arc</a>”\nand “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04814\">Planar Robot Casting</a>” while incorporating ideas from Huy Ha and\nShuran Song’s legendary <a href=\"https://flingbot.cs.columbia.edu/\">FlingBot paper</a>. While FlingBot uses two arms, many\nrobots have only one arm, and we show how to parameterize the action space in a\nway to make the search space tractable for learning. It was really fun to work\nwith this “DMODO” team (Dynamic Manipulation of Deformable Objects) over the\nlast few years and I hope to continue doing so.</p>\n\n<p>I am also very excited about the second paper. This is my first paper developed\nentirely at CMU, and it’s also my first one which incorporates <em>tactile\nsensing</em>. When I first pitched project ideas to my postdoc host while he was\ninterviewing me last year, I suggested using tactile sensing for fabric\nmanipulation to give a robot local information that it might not get from\nvision (e.g., due to occlusions), and as such I’m really happy that we got this\nsystem working.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, we focus on <em>multi-layer</em> fabric manipulation, which occurs all\nthe time when trying to fold and unfold fabrics such as clothing. Grasping an\nincorrect number of fabric layers has been a recurring failure in our prior\nwork on fabric smoothing and folding. As is typical for me, many of my research\nideas arise out of thinking about how I can address existing failure cases.\nAfter initially trying the GelSight sensor (used by many at CMU), we ended up\nusing <a href=\"https://reskin.dev/\">the ReSkin sensor</a> (a CMU research product … anyone seeing a trend?)\nwhich has a small form factor to allow the robot to singulate and separate\nlayers. While the actual machine learning in this paper is a little less\nrelative to my other papers, I’m OK with this if it’s the approach that worked\nthe best out of what we tried. In my view there’s no need to force more complex\nand elegant algorithms for the sake of doing so if those are not the right tool\nfor the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, neither of these two papers use a fabric simulator. I invested an\n<em>enormous</em> amount of time trying to get one working for the tactile sensing\npaper, but it didn’t work out. I’m really thankful, therefore, that my\nwonderful colleagues Sashank Tirumala and Thomas Weng resolved a lot of the\nhardware details in time for the paper.</p>\n\n<p>These papers have been accepted to ISRR 2022 and IROS 2022 for presentation\nlater this year. The conferences are at really interesting locations: Geneva,\nSwitzerland for ISRR and Kyoto, Japan for IROS.  Given its location, and the\n<a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2022/02/25/ukraine/\">offensive, unprovoked wars going on</a> in parts of the world, I hope ISRR\nwill include some information about the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions_and_their_additional_protocols\">Geneva Conventions</a> as part of the\nconference experience. If you’re curious, the last ISRR was in 2019 just before\nCOVID in Hanoi, Vietnam. I attended that conference to present a paper and\n<a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/10/13/isrr-day-01/\">blogged about it daily</a>, a habit which I am less likely do these days due\nto limited bandwidth. (The main “social” aspect of ISRR 2019 was a tour of\nHalong Bay.)</p>\n\n<p>I hope those who are going to the conferences have the chance to discuss these\npapers with my colleagues. For various reasons, I am not planning to attend\neither conference in person. At least the papers themselves are now on arXiv\nand fit for research consumption. Let us know if you have any questions.</p>",

The first paper, which we started a while\nback in Spring 2021, is about <em>dynamic</em> fabric manipulation; it can be thought\nof as an extension of our earlier ICRA papers on “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04840\">Robots of the Lost Arc</a>”\nand “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04814\">Planar Robot Casting</a>” while incorporating ideas from Huy Ha and\nShuran Song’s legendary <a href=\"https://flingbot.cs.columbia.edu/\">FlingBot paper</a>. While FlingBot uses two arms, many\nrobots have only one arm, and we show how to parameterize the action space in a\nway to make the search space tractable for learning. It was really fun to work\nwith this “DMODO” team (Dynamic Manipulation of Deformable Objects) over the\nlast few years and I hope to continue doing so.</p>\n\n<p>I am also very excited about the second paper. This is my first paper developed\nentirely at CMU, and it’s also my first one which incorporates <em>tactile\nsensing</em>. When I first pitched project ideas to my postdoc host while he was\ninterviewing me last year, I suggested using tactile sensing for fabric\nmanipulation to give a robot local information that it might not get from\nvision (e.g., due to occlusions), and as such I’m really happy that we got this\nsystem working.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, we focus on <em>multi-layer</em> fabric manipulation, which occurs all\nthe time when trying to fold and unfold fabrics such as clothing. Grasping an\nincorrect number of fabric layers has been a recurring failure in our prior\nwork on fabric smoothing and folding. As is typical for me, many of my research\nideas arise out of thinking about how I can address existing failure cases.\nAfter initially trying the GelSight sensor (used by many at CMU), we ended up\nusing <a href=\"https://reskin.dev/\">the ReSkin sensor</a> (a CMU research product … anyone seeing a trend?)\nwhich has a small form factor to allow the robot to singulate and separate\nlayers. While the actual machine learning in this paper is a little less\nrelative to my other papers, I’m OK with this if it’s the approach that worked\nthe best out of what we tried. In my view there’s no need to force more complex\nand elegant algorithms for the sake of doing so if those are not the right tool\nfor the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, neither of these two papers use a fabric simulator. I invested an\n<em>enormous</em> amount of time trying to get one working for the tactile sensing\npaper, but it didn’t work out. I’m really thankful, therefore, that my\nwonderful colleagues Sashank Tirumala and Thomas Weng resolved a lot of the\nhardware details in time for the paper.</p>\n\n<p>These papers have been accepted to ISRR 2022 and IROS 2022 for presentation\nlater this year. The conferences are at really interesting locations: Geneva,\nSwitzerland for ISRR and Kyoto, Japan for IROS.  Given its location, and the\n<a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2022/02/25/ukraine/\">offensive, unprovoked wars going on</a> in parts of the world, I hope ISRR\nwill include some information about the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/geneva_conventions_and_their_additional_protocols\">Geneva Conventions</a> as part of the\nconference experience. If you’re curious, the last ISRR was in 2019 just before\nCOVID in Hanoi, Vietnam. I attended that conference to present a paper and\n<a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2019/10/13/isrr-day-01/\">blogged about it daily</a>, a habit which I am less likely do these days due\nto limited bandwidth. (The main “social” aspect of ISRR 2019 was a tour of\nHalong Bay.)</p>\n\n<p>I hope those who are going to the conferences have the chance to discuss these\npapers with my colleagues. For various reasons, I am not planning to attend\neither conference in person. At least the papers themselves are now on arXiv\nand fit for research consumption. Let us know if you have any questions.</p>"

      "summary": "<p><em>This is a regularly updated post, last updated June 10, 2025.</em></p>\n\n<p>In academia, for better or worse, we have what’s called a <em>peer review</em> system,\nwhere papers get accepted to journals, conferences, or other venues on the\nbasis of reviews from other researchers, who ideally are subject area experts\nand thus are qualified to evaluate the paper. The reviewers also cannot have a\nconflict of interest with the authors, and should not be overwhelmed with too\nmany papers to review. This is the ideal world, and is <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/ex/pamphlets/publishing-models.html\">not always what happens\nin practice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience in the robotics academic community (and this may apply to\nother disciplines), it generally seems like there is no standard definition of\nan “appropriate” or “maximum” reviewing load for a reviewer. This is difficult\nto define as different papers mandate different reviewing efforts; a massive\njournal paper requires more time and effort than 2-3 page workshop papers.\nFurthermore, reviewing responsibilities can and should change depending on the\nprogression of a researcher’s career. Consequently, this blog post serves to\nshare my reviewing load. Hopefully I will continually update this post to\nbetter track (and limit) my reviewing load.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a detailed look at my reviewing load.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"based-on-publication-venue\">Based on Publication Venue</h2>\n\n<p>The standard publication venues for the robotics work that I do are ICRA, IROS,\nCoRL, RSS, and the IEEE RA-L journal, so most of my reviewing is concentrated\nthere.  Also, the “RA-L journal” is a bit nuanced in that papers can be\nsubmitted there with the option of a presentation at a conference such as ICRA,\nIROS, and CASE, hence why some researchers will write on their CVs and\nwebsites: “Paper published at IEEE RA-L with ICRA presentation option.” I am\nnot counting such papers when I list ICRA, IROS, and CASE paper reviews.</p>\n\n<p>The IEEE conferences have <em>Associate Editors</em> (AE). These are experienced\nresearchers in charge of recruiting reviewers for papers and later recommending\nto accept or reject to senior editors. I served as an AE for the first time for\nIROS 2022.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE conferences also allow for reviewer delegation, where one can technically\nbe assigned to review a paper, but formally request someone else to fill it\nout. I am not counting those cases for my reviewing load.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, here are the papers. When I list “papers in year X” that\nmeans that I reviewed them for the venue / conference that happens at that year\n(X). This might mean the actual reviewing happened the year before. For\nexample, I reviewed ICRA 2023 papers in 2022, but <em>I list them as “ICRA 2023”\nhere</em>.  In other cases, such as CoRL, I review them the same year the papers\nare presented (since CoRL is near the end of the year). Of course, some (if not\nmost) of the papers don’t get accepted.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>CoRL</strong>: 4 in 2020, 5 in 2021, 3 in 2022, 4 in 2023. <em>AC duties</em>: 9 in 2024, 9 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>RSS</strong>: 3 in 2023, 4 in 2024, 3 in 2025. <em>For workshops</em>: 2 in 2020, 2 in 2021, <a href=\"https://rssvlrr.github.io/\">both for the\nVisual Learning and Reasoning</a> workshop.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ICRA</strong>: 3 in 2020, 3 in 2021, 5 in 2022, 3 in 2023, 3 in 2024, 2 in 2025.\n<em>For workshops</em>: 6 in 2022, 6 in 2023, 11 in 2024, 4 in 2025. <em>For workshop proposals</em>: 1 in 2023, 2 in 2024, 1 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IROS</strong>: 1 in 2019, 3 in 2020, 4 in 2021, 2 in 2022, 2 in 2023, 3 in 2024, 2 in 2025.\n<em>AE duties</em>: 8 in 2022, 5 in 2023, 7 in 2024, 8 in 2025. <em>For workshop proposals</em>: 1 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>CASE</strong>: 1 in 2018, 1 in 2019, and 1 in 2021.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ISRR</strong>: 2 in 2022.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IEEE TASE</strong>: 1 in 2022, 1 in 2023.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IEEE RA-L</strong>: 2 in 2021, 4 in 2022, 2 in 2023, 4 in 2024, 2 in 2025.\n<em>AE duties</em>: 6 in 2024, 5 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IEEE T-RO</strong>: 1 in 2021, 2 in 2022, 1 in 2025.

I did some workshop paper reviewing:\nin 2020, I reviewed 3 workshop papers for the <a href=\"https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/\">Offline RL workshop</a>, and\nin 2021 I reviewed 3 workshop papers, two for the <a href=\"https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/2021/\">Offline RL workshop\n(again)</a> and one for the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/safe-robust-control/home\">Safe and Robust Control</a> workshop.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ICML</strong>: just 1 workshop paper in 2023.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ICCV</strong>: 2 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"based-on-year\">Based on Year</h2>\n\n<p>This list begins in 2019, since that’s when I started getting a lot of\nreviewing requests (and also publishing more papers, as you can see from <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ECHSnpYAAAAJ\">my\nGoogle Scholar account</a>).</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, and as I said at earlier, these are how many papers I\nreviewed <em>during that calendar year</em>.  For example ICRA is in the late spring\nand early summer most years, but the reviewing happens the prior fall.

        "value": "<p><em>This is a regularly updated post, last updated June 10, 2025.</em></p>\n\n<p>In academia, for better or worse, we have what’s called a <em>peer review</em> system,\nwhere papers get accepted to journals, conferences, or other venues on the\nbasis of reviews from other researchers, who ideally are subject area experts\nand thus are qualified to evaluate the paper. The reviewers also cannot have a\nconflict of interest with the authors, and should not be overwhelmed with too\nmany papers to review. This is the ideal world, and is <a href=\"http://yann.lecun.com/ex/pamphlets/publishing-models.html\">not always what happens\nin practice</a>.</p>\n\n<p>From my experience in the robotics academic community (and this may apply to\nother disciplines), it generally seems like there is no standard definition of\nan “appropriate” or “maximum” reviewing load for a reviewer. This is difficult\nto define as different papers mandate different reviewing efforts; a massive\njournal paper requires more time and effort than 2-3 page workshop papers.\nFurthermore, reviewing responsibilities can and should change depending on the\nprogression of a researcher’s career. Consequently, this blog post serves to\nshare my reviewing load. Hopefully I will continually update this post to\nbetter track (and limit) my reviewing load.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a detailed look at my reviewing load.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"based-on-publication-venue\">Based on Publication Venue</h2>\n\n<p>The standard publication venues for the robotics work that I do are ICRA, IROS,\nCoRL, RSS, and the IEEE RA-L journal, so most of my reviewing is concentrated\nthere.  Also, the “RA-L journal” is a bit nuanced in that papers can be\nsubmitted there with the option of a presentation at a conference such as ICRA,\nIROS, and CASE, hence why some researchers will write on their CVs and\nwebsites: “Paper published at IEEE RA-L with ICRA presentation option.” I am\nnot counting such papers when I list ICRA, IROS, and CASE paper reviews.</p>\n\n<p>The IEEE conferences have <em>Associate Editors</em> (AE). These are experienced\nresearchers in charge of recruiting reviewers for papers and later recommending\nto accept or reject to senior editors. I served as an AE for the first time for\nIROS 2022.</p>\n\n<p>IEEE conferences also allow for reviewer delegation, where one can technically\nbe assigned to review a paper, but formally request someone else to fill it\nout. I am not counting those cases for my reviewing load.</p>\n\n<p>Without further ado, here are the papers. When I list “papers in year X” that\nmeans that I reviewed them for the venue / conference that happens at that year\n(X). This might mean the actual reviewing happened the year before. For\nexample, I reviewed ICRA 2023 papers in 2022, but <em>I list them as “ICRA 2023”\nhere</em>.  In other cases, such as CoRL, I review them the same year the papers\nare presented (since CoRL is near the end of the year). Of course, some (if not\nmost) of the papers don’t get accepted.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>CoRL</strong>: 4 in 2020, 5 in 2021, 3 in 2022, 4 in 2023. <em>AC duties</em>: 9 in 2024, 9 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>RSS</strong>: 3 in 2023, 4 in 2024, 3 in 2025. <em>For workshops</em>: 2 in 2020, 2 in 2021, <a href=\"https://rssvlrr.github.io/\">both for the\nVisual Learning and Reasoning</a> workshop.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ICRA</strong>: 3 in 2020, 3 in 2021, 5 in 2022, 3 in 2023, 3 in 2024, 2 in 2025.\n<em>For workshops</em>: 6 in 2022, 6 in 2023, 11 in 2024, 4 in 2025. <em>For workshop proposals</em>: 1 in 2023, 2 in 2024, 1 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IROS</strong>: 1 in 2019, 3 in 2020, 4 in 2021, 2 in 2022, 2 in 2023, 3 in 2024, 2 in 2025.\n<em>AE duties</em>: 8 in 2022, 5 in 2023, 7 in 2024, 8 in 2025. <em>For workshop proposals</em>: 1 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>CASE</strong>: 1 in 2018, 1 in 2019, and 1 in 2021.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ISRR</strong>: 2 in 2022.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IEEE TASE</strong>: 1 in 2022, 1 in 2023.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IEEE RA-L</strong>: 2 in 2021, 4 in 2022, 2 in 2023, 4 in 2024, 2 in 2025.\n<em>AE duties</em>: 6 in 2024, 5 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>IEEE T-RO</strong>: 1 in 2021, 2 in 2022, 1 in 2025.

I did some workshop paper reviewing:\nin 2020, I reviewed 3 workshop papers for the <a href=\"https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/\">Offline RL workshop</a>, and\nin 2021 I reviewed 3 workshop papers, two for the <a href=\"https://offline-rl-neurips.github.io/2021/\">Offline RL workshop\n(again)</a> and one for the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/safe-robust-control/home\">Safe and Robust Control</a> workshop.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ICML</strong>: just 1 workshop paper in 2023.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>ICCV</strong>: 2 in 2025.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"based-on-year\">Based on Year</h2>\n\n<p>This list begins in 2019, since that’s when I started getting a lot of\nreviewing requests (and also publishing more papers, as you can see from <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=ECHSnpYAAAAJ\">my\nGoogle Scholar account</a>).</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, and as I said at earlier, these are how many papers I\nreviewed <em>during that calendar year</em>.  For example ICRA is in the late spring\nand early summer most years, but the reviewing happens the prior fall. Thus, I\nwould list papers I reviewed for ICRA 2020 in 2019 (not 2020) in the list\nbelow. In contrast, reviewing ICRA <em>workshop</em> papers happens the same year when\nthe conference happens.

You can find the other blog posts from prior years\n(going back to 2016) in the blog archives.</p>\n\n<p>Books with asterisks are ones that I would especially recommend.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"popular-science\">Popular Science</h1>\n\n<p>This also includes popular science, which means the authors might not be\ntechnically trained as scientists.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Who We Are and How We Got Here: Ancient DNA and the New Science of the\nHuman Past</strong> (2018) is by famous geneticist and Harvard professor <a href=\"https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/\">David\nReich</a>. Scientific advances in analyzing DNA have allowed better analysis\nof human population migration patterns. The prior model of humans migrating\nout of Africa and to Europe, Asia, and the Americas in a “tree-like” fashion\nis out of date. Instead, <em>mixture is fundamental to who we are</em> as\npopulations have migrated and mixed in countless ways. Also, ancient DNA can\nshow the genetic percentage of an ancient population (including Neanderthals)\nin modern-day populations. A practical benefit from these studies is the\nability to identify population groups as more at risk to certain diseases to\nothers, but as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html\">Reich is careful to point out</a> there’s a danger in that\nsuch studies can be exploited to nefarious means (e.g., racial stereotypes).\nI believe Reich’s justifications for working in this field make sense. If\nscientists try to avoid the question of whether there might be the <em>slightest\npossibility</em> of genetic differences among different populations, then the\nresulting void will be filled by racist and pseudo-scientific thinkers. Reich\nshows that the heavy mixture among different populations shatters beliefs\nheld by Nazis and others regarding “pure races.” Science, when properly\nunderstood, helps us better respect the diversity of humans today.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art</strong> (2020) by Rebecca Wragg\nSykes summarizes what researchers believe about <em>Neanderthals</em>, a species\nvery closely related to <em>Homo Sapiens</em> (i.e., modern humans) who lived many\nthousands of years ago primarily in Europe and Asia.  Neanderthals captivate\nour imagination since they are so much like ourselves. In fact, interbreeding\nwas possible and did happen. But at some point, Neanderthals went extinct.\n<em>Kindred</em> reviews the cutting-edge science behind what Neanderthals were\nlike: what did they eat, how did they live, where did they migrate to, and so\non. (I was pleased to see that some of this information was also in David\nReich’s book <em>Who We Are and How We Got Here</em>.) The main takeaway I got is\nthat we should not view Neanderthals as a “less intelligent” version of\nmodern humans.  The book is a nice overview, and I am amazed that we are able\nto deduce this much from so long ago.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</strong> (2020) by James Nestor is about\nbreathing. We all breathe, but breathing is not taught or discussed as widely\nas diet or exercise.  Nestor describes an experiment where he stuffed his\nnose and was forced to mouth-breathe for 10 days. The result?  Higher blood\npressure, worse sleep, and a host of other adverse effects.  Nestor also\ninterviews historians, scientists, and those knowledgeable about breathing,\nto learn why humans have changed breathing habits for the worse, resulting in\ncrooked teeth, worse sleep, and so on. The book concludes with some breathing\nadvice: nose breathing, chewing, holding your breath, and suggesting certain\nbreathing strategies. Written instructions for breathing can be hard to\nfollow, so <a href=\"https://www.mrjamesnestor.com/breath\">Nestor has a website</a> with more information, including videos\nand additional expert advice. I’m not sure how much I will directly benefit\nfrom this book, given that I was already a strong nose-breather, and I don’t\nbelieve I suffer from snoring or sleep apnea — any sleep issues I might\nhave are likely due to either (a) looking at too many screens (phones,\nlaptops, etc.), or (b) thinking about the state of the world while my brain\ncannot calm down. It also feels like the book might over-exaggerate\nbreathing, but to his credit, Nestor states that breathing is not going to\ncure everything.  At the very least, it was nice to see a reaffirmation of my\nbasic breathing habits, and I had not thought too much of my breathing habits\nbefore reading <em>Breath</em>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>What To Expect When You’re Expecting Robots: The Future of Human-Robot\nCollaboration</strong> ** (2020) by Laura Major and Julie Shah. The authors are\nroboticists, and I am familiar with Julie Shah’s name (she’s a Professor at\nMIT) and her research area of human-robot interaction.<sup id=\"fnref:berkeley\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:berkeley\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> This book\nfrequently refers to <em>aviation</em>, since it was one of the fields that\npioneered a balance between humans and automation (robots) in real time in a\nsafety-critical setting. In what cases does the aviation analogy hold for\nrobots interacting with humans on the ground? As compared to aviation\nsettings, there is a wider diversity of things that could happen, and we do\nnot have the luxury that aviation has with highly trained humans paired with\nthe robot (plane); we need robots that can quickly interact with everyday\npeople.  The authors present the key concept of <em>affordances</em>, or designing\nrobots so that they “make sense” to humans, similar to how we can view a\nvariety of mugs but immediately understand the function of the handle.\nThinking about other books I’ve read in the past, the one that comes closest\nto this is <em>Our Robots, Ourselves</em> where MIT Professor David Mindell\ndiscussed the history of aviation as it pertains to automation.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know</strong> (2021) is Adam\nGrant’s third book, following <em>Give and Take</em> and <em>Originals</em>, all of which I\nhave read. At a time when America seems hyper-polarized, Grant shows that it\nis possible and better for people to be willing to change their minds.\n<em>Think Again</em> is written in his usual style, which is to present a\npsychological concept and back it up with research and anecdotes. Grant cites\nthe story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/daryl-davis-black-musician-who-converts-ku-klux-klan-members\">Daryl Davis</a>, a Black musician who has successfully\nconvinced dozens of former Ku Klux Klan members to abandon their prior\nbeliefs. While Grant correctly notes that it shouldn’t be the sole\nresponsibility of Black people like Davis to take the lead on something like\nthis, the point is to show that such change <em>is</em> possible.<sup id=\"fnref:sellout\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:sellout\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Grant\nalso mentions <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harish-natarajan-4a526627/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Harish Natarajan</a>, an expert debater who effectively\nargued against a computer on a topic where he might naturally start off on\nthe weaker end (he was asked to oppose “should we have universal\npreschool?”), and how Natarajan was able to force Grant to rethink some of\nhis beliefs. Being willing to change one’s mind has, in theory, the benefit\nof flexibility in adapting to better beliefs.  Overall, I think the book was\nreasonable.  I try to assume I am open to revising beliefs, and remind myself\nthis: if I feel very strongly in favor of anything (whether it be a political\nsystem, a person, a hypothesis, and so on) then I should be prepared to\npresent a list of <em>what would cause me to change my mind</em>. Doing that might\ngo a long way to reduce tensions in today’s society.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought AI to Google, Facebook, and\nthe World</strong> ** (2021) by journalist Cade Metz. He writes about AI, and I\nfrequently see his name floated around in articles about AI. <em>Genius Makers</em>\nis about AI and Deep Learning, and where it’s going. There are four main\nparts: the rise of Deep Learning, successes and hype (think AlphaGo), turmoil\nand dangers (bias in AI, militarization of AI, etc.), and the future.\nThroughout the book, there are stories about the key players in AI.  As\nexpected, featured players include Geoff Hinton, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio,\nJeff Dean, Andrew Ng, and Fei-Fei Li. The key companies include Google,\nFacebook, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Baidu.  I follow AI news regularly, and the\nbook contains some Berkeley-related material, so I knew much of the books’\ncontents. Nonetheless, there was still new material. For example, I think\njust about everyone in AI these days is aware that Geoff Hinton is “The Man\nWho Didn’t Sit Down” (the title of the prologue) but I didn’t know that\nGoogle bid <em>44 million USD</em> for his startup, beating out Baidu.  While I\nreally like this book, <em>Genius Makers</em> may have overlap with other AI books\n(see my prior book reading lists for some examples) such that those who don’t\nwant to consume dozens of books about AI may prefer other options.  However,\nthis one probably contains the most information about how the key players\nhave <em>interacted</em> with each other.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"history-government-politics-economics\">History, Government, Politics, Economics</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas</strong>\n** (2016) is a massive book by historian and antiracist Ibram X. Kendi.\nThe “stamped from the beginning” term comes from former US Senator Jefferson\nDavis, who stated this in 1860 as the rationale for the inequality of whites\nand blacks. Kendi presents the history of racial inequality, with a focus on\nhow <em>racist ideas</em> have persisted in America. There are five parts, each\ncentering around a main character: Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, William\nLloyd Garrison, W.E.B. du Bois, and Angela Davis.  Throughout each chapter,\nKendi emphasizes that it was not necessarily <em>hatred of other races</em> that led\nto racism, but instead, racist thinking <em>helped to justify</em> existing racial\ndisparities. He also frequently returns to three key ideas: (1) segregationst\nthought, (2) assimilationist thought, and (3) antiracist thought. While (1)\nseems obviously racist, Kendi argues that (2) is also racist. Kendi also\npoints out inconsistencies in the way that people have treated people of\ndifferent races. For example, consider Thomas Jefferson’s hypocrisy in\ncriticizing interracial relationships, while he himself had sexual\nrelationships with his (lighter-skinned) slaves, including Sally\nHemingway.<sup id=\"fnref:american\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:american\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> More generally it raises the question of the most\nimportant phrase in the Declaration of Independence, that “all men are\ncreated equal.” It is one that I hope we will continually strive to achieve.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>How Democracies Die</strong> ** (2018) is a well-timed, chilling, concise,\nand persuasive warning of how democracies can decay into authoritarianism.\nIt’s written by Harvard Professors <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/levitsky/home\">Steven Levitsky</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/dziblatt/home\">Daniel\nZiblatt</a>, who specialize in democracies in Europe and Latin America.\nDuring the Cold War, democracies often died in the hands of military coups.\nBut nowadays, they are dying in a more subtle way: by elected officials who\nuse the system to subvert it from within. Those trends in America were\ndeveloping for years, and burst in 2016 with the election of Trump, who\nsatisfies the warning signs that Levitsky and Ziblatt argue are indicative of\nauthoritarianism: (1) weak commitment to democratic rules of the game, (2)\ndenial of the legitimacy of political opponents, (3) toleration or\nencouragement of violence, (4) readiness to curtail civil liberties of\nopponents, including media. Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that it’s not the\n<em>text</em> of the US Constitution that helped American democracy survive for\nyears, as other countries have copied the US Constitution but still decayed\ninto authoritarian rule. Rather, it’s the enforcement of democratic norms:\nmutual toleration and institutional forbearance. They review the history of\nAmerica and cite historical events showing those democratic norms in action\n(e.g., stopping FDR’s court packing attempt), but admit that the times when\ndemocratic norms appeared more robust in America were at the same times when\nthe issue of racism was de-prioritized.  They ultimately hope that a\nmulti-racial democracy can be combined with democratic norms.  The book was\nwritten in 2018, and while they didn’t directly predict the COVID-19\npandemic, which may have exacerbated some anti-democratic trends (for\nexample, by inhibiting the ability of government to function), Levitsky and\nZiblatt were on the money when it comes to some of their authoritarian\npredictors.  Trump suggesting that the election could be delayed? Yes. The\nrefusal of many politicians to accept the results of the 2020 election\n(highlighted by the insurrection of 01/06)? Yes.  <em>How Democracies Die</em>\nreminds me of <em>The Fifth Risk</em> where an equally prescient Michael Lewis wrote\nabout the dangers of what happens when people in government don’t understand\ntheir duties. A commitment to democratic norms must be considered part of an\nelected official’s duties.  I will keep this in mind and urge America towards\na more democratic future. I don’t want to live in an authoritarian country\nwhich curtails free religion, free speech, an independent media, an\nindependent judiciary, and where one man does the decision-making with\ninsufficient checks and balances.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Learning from the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil</strong> (2019) by Susan\nNeiman, a Jewish woman, born in 1955, who has been a philosophy professor in\nthe United States and Israel, and has also lived in Germany.  I saw this\nlisted in the recommended reading references in a <em>Foreign Affairs</em> magazine.\n<em>Learning from the Germans</em> consists of (1) Germany’s history of confronting\nits Nazi past, (2) America’s history of reckoning with slavery, and (3) a\ndiscussion over monuments, reparations, and what the future may hold for\nAmerica and other countries that have to face prior sins. I learned about the\ncomplex and uneven path Germany took towards providing reparations to Jews,\nremoving Nazi memorials, and so on, with East Germany handling this process\nbetter than West Germany. Neiman believes that Germany has responded to its\npast in a better way than the United States (with respect to slavery).<sup id=\"fnref:na\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:na\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>\nIt’s intriguing that many of the Germans who Neiman interviewed as part of\nher research rejected the title of the book, since they were ashamed of their\ncountry’s past, and surprised that others would want to learn from it. Neiman\nsays it’s complicated to develop “moral equivalences” between events, but\nthat ultimately what matters is how we address our past. If I were to\ncriticize something happening in country “X”, and someone from that country\nwere to respond back to me by criticizing America’s past sins, my response\nwould be simply: “yes, you’re right, America <em>has</em> been bad, <em>and</em> here is\nwhat I am doing to rectify this …”.  It’s not a contradiction to\nsimultaneously hold the following beliefs, as I do, that: (1) I enjoy living\nin America, and (2) I am very cognizant and ashamed of many historical sins\nof America’s past (and present).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Good Economics for Hard Times</strong> ** (2019) by Nobelists Abhijit\nBanerjee and Esther Duflo, both of MIT (and a married couple); <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGrYxWbyhg\">see the\nannouncement video</a> shortly after they won the prize. They give a\nwonderful tour of topics in economics, but also clarify that it’s not clear\nwhich policies <em>directly</em> lead to growth, as traditionally measured in GDP.\nMuch of the book emphasizes that there’s so much uncertainty in economics,\nand that given climate change, it might not be prudent to try to find the\nformula to maximize GDP. Rather, the goal should be to best address policies\nthat can serve the poor and disadvantaged.  <em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em>\nsimultaneously was a fast read but also one that felt like it got enough of\nthe technical information through to me. It’s not super likely to change the\nmind of growth-obsessed people, and it comes <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/good-economics-for-hard-times-review-sticky-markets-tricky-solutions-11574021736\">with some critique of\nTrump-style Conservatism</a>. I think it was a great book for me, and one of\nmy favorites this year.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</strong> ** (2019) is\nby Margaret O’Mara, a Professor of History at the University of Washington\nwho researches at the intersection of technology and American politics.\nHence, she is the ideal person to write this kind of book, and I have high\ninterest in the subject area, since my research is in robotics and AI more\nbroadly, the latter of which is the topic of interest in Silicon Valley\ntoday. O’Mara starts at the end of World War II, when the leaders in tech\nwere on the East Coast near Boston and MIT. Over the next few decades, the\nSan Francisco Bay Area would develop tremendously and by the 1980s, would\nsurpass the East Coast in becoming the undisputed tech capital of the world.\nHow this happened is a remarkable story of visionaries who began tech\ncompanies, such as Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page\n(and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos up north in Seattle, though all have heavy\nconnections with Silicon Valley) and venture capitalists like John Doerr.\nHowever, and perhaps this is the less interesting part, the story of Silicon\nValley is also one of sufficient government funding for both companies and\nuniversities (notably, Stanford University), along with immigration from\ntalented foreigners across the world, resulting in what O’Mara calls an\n“only-in-America story” made possible by broader political and economic\ncurrents.  O’Mara is careful to note that this prosperity was not shared\nwidely, nor could it truly be called a true meritocracy given the sexism in\nthe industry (as elaborated further in Emily Chang’s <em>Brotopia</em>) and that\nwealth went mainly to the top few white, and then Asian, men. O’Mara\nbrilliantly summarizes Silicon Valley’s recent history in a readable tome.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The World: A Brief Introduction</strong> ** (2020) is by Richard Haass,\npresident of the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/\">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, which is my go-to think\ntank for foreign affairs. I started this book and couldn’t stop myself from\nfinishing. It’s definitely on the side of <em>breadth</em> instead of <em>depth</em>.  It\nwon’t add much to those who are regular readers of <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, let\nalone foreign policy experts; Haass’  goal is to “provide the basics of what\nyou need to know about the world, to make you more globally literate.” The\nbook begins with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which encoded the concept\nof the modern international system governed by countries. Obviously, it\ndidn’t end up creating permanent peace, as the world saw World War I, World\nWar II, the Cold War, and then the period after the Cold War up to today,\nwhich Haas said will later be given a common name by historians upon\nconsensus. My favorite part of the book is the second one, which covers\ndifferent regions of the world. The third part is the longest and covers\nchallenges of globalization, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, climate\nchange, and so on.  The last one is broadly titled “order and disorder.”\nWhile I knew much of the material in the book, I was still able to learn\naspects about worldwide finance and trade (among other topics) and I think\n<em>The World</em> does a valuable service in getting the reader on a good\nfoundation for subsequent understanding of the world.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"biographies--memoirs\">Biographies / Memoirs</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</strong> ** (2016) by Phil\nKnight, currently a billionaire and Nike cofounder, with Bill Bowerman.  Each\nchapter describes a year (1962 through 1980) in Phil Knight’s early days in\nOregon, where he co-founded Blue Ribbon Sports (later, Nike).  <em>Shoe Dog</em> —\nnamed after the phrase describing people who know shoes and footwear inside\nout — is refreshingly honest, showing the challenges Knight faced with\ngetting shoes from factories in Japan. Initially they relied on Onitsuka, but\nNike had a protracted legal challenge regarding distribution rights and\nswitched suppliers. Furthermore, Knight had a tough time securing funding and\nloans from banks, who didn’t believe that the company’s growth rate would be\nenough to pay them back. Knight eventually relied on Nissho<sup id=\"fnref:nissho\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:nissho\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup>, a\nJapanese guarantor, for funds.  Basically, the cycle was: get loan from\nNissho, make sales, pay back Nissho, and repeat.  Eventually, Nike reached a\nsize and scope comparable to Adidas and Puma, the two main competitors to\nNike at that time.  Nowadays, things have probably changed. Companies like\nUber continually lose money, but are able to get funding, so perhaps there’s\nmore of a “Venture Capitalist mentality” these days. Also, I worry if it is\nnecessary to cut corners in business to succeed.  For example, in the early\ndays, Knight lied to Onitsuka about having an office on the east coast, and\nafter signing a contract with Onitsuka, Knight had to scramble to get a\nfactory there! Things have to be different in today’s faster-paced and\nInternet-fueled world, but hopefully the spirit of entrepreneurship lives on.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood</strong> ** (2016), by\ncomedian Trevor Noah, was great. I’m aware of his work, though have never\nwatched his comedy.  He was “Born a Crime” as the son of a White (Swiss)\nfather and a Black mother, which was illegal under South Africa’s apartheid\nsystem. Noah was <em>Colored</em>, and could not be seen with his mother in many\nplaces without the risk of police catching him. I realized (though I’m sure I\nwas taught this earlier but forgot it) that in South Africa’s apartheid\nsystem, whites were actually a <em>minority</em>, but apartheid allowed whites to\nremain in control, and a key tactic was pitting different minority groups\nagainst each other, usually Blacks.<sup id=\"fnref:japan\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:japan\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> Noah had a few advantages here,\nsince he was multi-lingual and could socialize with different minority\ngroups, and his skin color looked light on film at that time. For example,\nNoah a Black friend robbed a mall, and he was caught on video. When the\nschool principals summoned Noah, they asked him if he knew who the “white”\nguy was in the video. The person was Noah, but the administrators were\nsomehow unable to tell that, blinded by certain notions of race.  Apartheid\nformally ended during Noah’s childhood, but the consequences would and still\nare reverberating throughout South Africa.  I’m frankly amazed at what Noah\novercame to be where he is today, and also at his mother, who survived\nattempts at near murder by an ex-husband. The answer isn’t more religion and\nprayer, it’s to remove apartheid and to ensure that police listen to women\nand properly punish men who commit domestic violence.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt\nDisney Company</strong> (2019) by Robert Iger is a readable book on leadership and\nbusiness, and provides the perspective of what it is like being a CEO at a\nhuge international company. The first half describes his initial career\nbefore being CEO, and the second half is about his experience as CEO. Iger\ndescribes the stress throughout the selection stage to see who would become\nCEO after Michael Eisner, and how Iger had to balance ambition of wanting the\njob without actually demanding it outright. There was also the complexity of\nhow Iger was already a Disney insider before becoming CEO, and some wanted to\nbring in a fresh outsider. I enjoyed his view on Steve Jobs, especially after\nhaving read Walter Isaccson’s biography of Steve Jobs last year. (Jobs had a\nsometimes adversarial relationship with Disney.) It’s also nice that there’s\n“no price on integrity” (the title of Chapter 13) and that Iger is supportive\nof cracking down on sexual assault and racism. I have a few concerns, though.\nFirst, it seems like most of the “innovation” happening at Disney, at least\nwhat’s featured in the book, is based on buying companies such as Pixar and\nLucasfilm, rather than in-house development. It’s great that Iger can check\nhis ego and the company’s ego, but it’s disappointing from an innovation\nperspective. Second, while there is indeed “no price on integrity,” how far\nshould businesses acquiesce to governments who place far more restrictions on\ncivil liberties than the United States government?  Iger also repeatedly\nemphasizes how lucky he was and how important it was for others to support\nhim, but what about others who don’t have that luxury?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The Great Successor: The Divinely Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade\nKim Jong Un</strong> ** (2019) by New Zealand journalist Anna Fifield. This book\nis extremely similar to the next book I’m listing here (by Jung H. Pak), so\nI’m going to combine my thoughts there.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Becoming Kim Jong Un: A Former CIA Officer’s Insights into North\nKorea’s Enigmatic Young Dictator</strong> ** (2020) by Jung H. Pak, who used to\nwork in the CIA and has since been at the Brookings Institution and in the US\nState department.  I have to confess, my original objective was to read a\nbiography of Xi Jinping. When I tried to search for one, I came across UC\nIrvine Professor <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/01/xi-jinping-china-biography/617852/\">Jeffrey Wasserstrom’s article in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> saying\nthat there <em>weren’t</em> any good biographies of Xi.<sup id=\"fnref:wasserstrom\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:wasserstrom\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> The same\narticle then said there were two biographies of Kim Jong Un, and that’s how I\nfound and read these two books. I’m glad I did!  Both do a good service in\ncovering Kim Jong Un’s life from North Korea royalty to Switzerland for\nschool, then back to North Korea to get groomed for future leadership,\nfollowed by his current leadership since 2011. I vaguely remember when he\nfirst came to power, and seeing news reports questioning whether Kim Jong Un\ntruly held power, since he was the youngest head of state at that time. But\nthe last decade has shown that Kim’s grip on power is ironclad.  There are\nonly a few differences in the topics that the books cover, and I think one of\nthem is that near the end of <em>Becoming Kim Jong Un</em>, Pak ponders about how to\ndeal with the nuclear question. She argues that rather than do a misguided\nfirst strike like John Bolton once foolishly suggested in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-legal-case-for-striking-north-korea-first-1519862374\">a WSJ op-ed</a>\njust before he became the US National Security Advisor for former president\nTrump, we have to consider a more nuanced view of Kim and realize that he\nwill only give up nuclear weapons if maintaining them comes at too great a\ncost to bear. Since the book was published, COVID-19 happened, and if there’s\nbeen any single event that’s caused more harm to North Korea’s economy, it’s\nbeen this, as exemplified by how Russian diplomats had to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/26/asia/north-korea-trolley-russian-diplomats-intl-hnk/index.html\">leave North Korea\nby hand-pushed rail</a>. I still maintain my view that Kim Jong Un is one of\nthe worst leaders alive today, and I hope that the North Korea situation can\nimprove even a tiny bit in 2021.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"china\">China</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China</strong> ** (2008)\nby Leslie T. Chang, who at that time was a journalist for the <em>Wall Street\nJournal</em>. I found out about this book when it was cited by Jeffrey\nWasserstrom and Maura Cunningham in their book. Chang was motivated to\nprovide an alternative perspective from a “traditional” American media, where\na lot of the focus is on dissidents and human rights (not a bad thing per se,\nbut it’s good to have balance). In this book, Chang meets and interviews\nmultiple women who came from rural areas to work in factories, particularly\nthose located in Dongguan, an industrial city in southern China in the Pearl\nRiver Delta region (a bit north of Hong Kong).  As a reporter who also could\nspeak in Mandarian, Chang is skillfully able to convey the women’s journey\nand life in a highly sympathetic manner. She does not sugarcoat the\ndifficulties of living as a factory worker; the women who she interviews have\nto work long hours, might see friendships end quickly, and have difficulties\nfinding suitable husbands in a city that has far more women than men.\n<em>Factory Girls</em> also contains Chang’s own exploration of her family history\nin China. While still interesting, my one minor comment is that I wonder if\nthis might have diluted the book’s message. Despite the 2008 publication\ndate, the book is still readable and it seems like the rural-to-urban shift\nin China is still ongoing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China</strong> ** (2011) is a\n<em>massive</em> history tome on the former Chinese leader by the great historian\nEzra F. Vogel, a long-time professor at Harvard University. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/world/asia/ezra-f-vogel-dead.html\">He passed away\nin late 2020</a>.) There likely are many other biographies of Deng and there\nmay be more in the future, but Vogel’s book is considered the “definitive”\none, and compared to later historians, Vogel will have had the advantage of\ninterviewing Deng’s direct family members and associates.  The reason for\nstudying Deng is obvious: since Deng took over the reins of China in 1978\nfollowing Mao’s death in 1976 and a brief interlude afterwards, he led\neconomic reforms that opened the world’s most populous country and helped to\nlift millions out of poverty. The bulk of the book covers Deng’s leadership\nfrom 1978 through 1992. This includes economic reforms such as the\nestablishment of “Special Economic Zones,” allowing foreign investment, and\nsending students abroad, largely to the United States, which also benefits\nfrom this relation, as <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2021/12/11/international-chinese/\">I hope my recent blogging makes clear</a>. It also\nincludes foreign affairs, such as the peaceful return of Hong Kong to China\nand the difficulties in reuniting China and Taiwan. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/world/asia/ezra-f-vogel-dead.html\">a recent NY Times\nobituary here states</a>, a criticism of Vogel’s book is that he might have\nbeen too lenient on Deng in his reporting, I do not share that criticism. In\nmy view the book presents a sufficiently comprehensive view of the good, bad,\nand questionable decisions from Deng that it’s hard for me to think of a\nharsh criticism.<sup id=\"fnref:china\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:china\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> (It is true, however, that the Chinese government\ncensored parts of this book for the Chinese translation, and <em>that</em> I\ndislike.) Vogel’s masterpiece is incredible, and I will remember it for a\nlong time.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>China Goes Global: The Partial Superpower</strong> ** (2012) is by David\nShambaugh, a professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at the\nGeorge Washington University (same department as Prof. Sean Roberts). From\nthe 1978 reforms which opened the country up to 2012, China’s been massively\ngrowing and asserting its influence on the world, but is not <em>yet</em> a\n“superpower” as would be suggested based on its population and economy. This\ncould be due to hesitancy in taking on greater international roles, as that\nmight require expensive interventions and undertakings that could hinder its\neconomic growth, which is the CCP’s main mandate to the Chinese people. One\nthing I immediately noticed: the book has the most amount of quotes,\ncitations, or interviews with Chinese government officials or academics than\nany other book I’ve read. (This was the pre-Xi era and the country was\ngenerally more open to foreigners.) Shambaugh does a great job conveying the\nwide range of opinions of the Chinese foreign policy elite. Two of the most\ncited scholars in the book are <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/experts/625\">Yan Xuetong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/wang-jisi\">Wang Jisi</a>, whose\nnames I recognized when I later read <em>Foreign Affairs</em> articles from them.\nAnother thing worth mentioning: Chinese officials have told Shambaugh that\nthey believe the “Western” media is misinformed and does not understand\nChina.  Shambaugh recalls replying, <em>what precisely</em> is the misunderstanding,\nand the government officials were aghast that there could be any\ndisagreement. In Shambaugh’s view, the media is tough but accurate on\nChina.<sup id=\"fnref:media\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:media\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> As Shambaugh emphasizes, so many people want to know <em>more</em>\nabout China (myself included, as can be obviously inferred!), and in my view\nthis means we get both the positive and the negative.  This book is a great\n(if somewhat dated) survey, and helps to boost my personal study of China.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>China Goes Green: Coercive Environmentalism for a Troubled Planet</strong> (2020)\nis co-written by professors Yifei Li and Judith Shapiro. The focus in <em>China\nGoes Green</em> is to discuss the following: in today’s era of accelerating\nclimate change (or climate <em>crisis</em>), is China’s authoritarian government\nsystem better suited to tackle environmental challenges? Some thinkers have\nposited that, while they may be sympathetic to liberal democracy and human\nrights, maybe the climate urgency of today means such debate and freedoms\nhave to be set aside in favor of “quicker” government actions by\nauthoritarian rule. Li and Shapiro challenge this line of reasoning. A\nrecurring theme is that China often projects that it wants to address climate\nchange and promote clean energy, but the policies it implements have the\nultimate goal of increasing government control over citizens while\nsimultaneously having mixed results on the actual environment.  That is,\ninstead of referring to China today as “authoritarian environmentalism”, the\nauthors argue that “environmental authoritarianism” is more accurate. The\nbook isn’t a page-turner, but it serves a useful niche in providing an\nunderstanding of how climate and government mesh in modern China.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The War on the Uyghurs: China’s Campaign Against Xinjiang’s Muslims</strong>\n** (2020) is by Sean Roberts, a professor at the Elliott School of\nInternational Affairs at the George Washington University (same department as\nProf. David Shambaugh). The Xinjiang internment camps of China have become\nhousehold names among readers of international news outlets, with reports of\ngenocide and forced labor. Roberts explains the tense history between the\nethnic Han majority in China versus the Turkic people who primarily live in\nthe rural, western areas of the country. A key part of the book is precisely\ndefining what “terrorism” means, as that has been the rationale for the\npersecution of the Uyghurs, and also other Muslim groups (including in the\nUnited States).  Roberts covers the Urumqi riots and other incidents that\ndeteriorated relations between Uyghurs and the Chinese government, and then\nthis led to what Roberts calls a “cultural genocide” that started from 2017\nand has continued today; Roberts recalled that he and other fellow academics\nstudying the subject realized something was wrong in 2017 when it became\nmassively harder to contact his colleagues from Xinjiang. One of the most\nrefreshing things (in my view) is reading this knowledge from an academic who\nhas long studied this history, instead of consuming information from\npoliticians (of both countries) who have interests in defending their\ncountry,<sup id=\"fnref:roberts\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:roberts\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> and Roberts is not shy about arguing that the United\nStates has unintentionally assisted China in its repression, particularly in\nthe designation of certain Muslim groups as “terrorism”. Of all the news that\nI’ve read in 2021, among those with an international focus, the one that\nperhaps stuck the most to my mind from 2021 is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/the-uyghur-chronicles/\">Tahir Izgil’s chilling\nstory</a> about how he escaped the camps in Xinjiang. While this is just one\ndata point of many, I hope that in some way the international community can\ndo what it can to provide refugee status to more Uyghurs. (I am a donor to\nthe Uyghur Human Rights Project.)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"covid-19\">COVID-19</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The Premonition: A Pandemic Story</strong> ** (2021) by Berkeley’s Michael\nLewis is the second book of his I read, after <em>The Fifth Risk</em> (published\n2018), which served as an unfortunate prologue for the American response to\nCOVID-19; I remembered <em>The Fifth Risk</em> quite well after reading <em>How\nDemocracies Die</em> earlier this year. I didn’t realize Lewis had another book\n(this one) and I devoured it as soon as I could. The US was ranked <em>number\none</em> among all countries in terms of pandemic preparation.  Let that sink in.\nBy the time it was mid-2021, the US had <em>the most recorded deaths of any\ncountry</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:recorded\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:recorded\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> Lewis’ brilliance in his book, as in his others, is to\nspotlight unsung heroes, such as a California health care official and a\nformer doctor who seemed to be more competent than the United States\ngovernment or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  Lewis is so good at\nconnecting the reader with these characters, that when reading the book, and\nseeing how they were stopped and stymied at seemingly every turn from\nsluggish government or CDC officials, I felt complete rage. (The same goes\nfor the World Health Organization, but the CDC is a US entity, so we have\nmore ability to reform it.) The biggest drawback of this book is that Lewis\ndoesn’t have any endnotes or details on how he went about investigating and\ninterviewing the people in his book. In all fairness, the officials he\ncriticizes in this book should have the opportunity to defend themselves.\nGiven the way the CDC acted early in the pandemic, though, and the number of\nrecorded deaths it would be surprising if they could mount effective\ndefenses, but again, they should have the opportunity. One more thing, I\ncan’t resist suggesting this idea: any current and future CDC director must\nhave a huge sign with these words: <strong>You must do what is right for public\nhealth.  You cannot let a politician silence or pressure you into saying what\nhe or she wants.</strong> This sign should be right at the desk of the CDC director,\nso he/she sees this on a daily basis.  Check out <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/03/991570372/michael-lewis-the-premonition-is-a-sweeping-indictment-of-the-cdc\">this further summary from\nNPR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5675\">some commentary by Scott Aaronson on his blog</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>World War C: lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic and How to Prepare\nfor the Next One</strong> ** (2021) is by CNN’s chief medical correspondent Dr.\nSanjay Gupta, released in October 2021, and I expect it to reach a wide\naudience due to Dr. Gupta’s position at CNN. After a brief review of the\nearly days of the pandemic, the book covers how diseases spread, the effects\nof COVID, and the function of vaccines. Then, it provides guidelines for\nbuilding resilience to the next pandemic. For the most part, the writing here\nseems reasonable, and my main disappointment doesn’t really have to do with\nDr. Gupta per se, but has to do with how understanding the effects of\n“long-haul COVID” is just going to take a lot of time and involve a lot of\nuncertainty. Also, and this may be a good (or not so good) thing but Dr.\nGupta, while acknowledging that politics played a role in hindering the war\nagainst the pandemic (particularly in the US), tries to avoid becoming too\npolitical. His last chapter, on ensuring that humanity fights together,\nresonates with me. In April 2021, India was hit with a catastrophic COVID\nwave due to the delta variant, and at least one of Dr. Gupta’s relatives\ndied. Since the virus constantly mutates, the world essentially has to be\nvaccinated against it at once to mitigate its spread.  As the Omicron variant\nwas spreading as I finished up this book near the end of the year, it’s\nimperative that we end up supporting humans throughout the world and give out\nas many vaccines as we can, which is one reason why I consider myself a\ncitizen of the world.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"other\">Other</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less</strong> (2016) by Alex Soojung-Kim\nPang, emphasizes the need for rest and recovery to improve productivity. This\nseems obvious. I mean, can you <em>really</em> work 16 hours a day with maximum\nenergy? Pang argues that it’s less common for people to think about\n“optimizing” their rest as opposed to things more directly related to\nproductivity. As he laments: “we think of rest as simply the absence of work,\nnot as something that stands on its own or has its own qualities.” The book\npresents anecdotes and studies about how some of the most creative and\naccomplished people (such as Charles Darwin) were able to do what they did in\nlarge part due to rest, or taking breaks such as engaging in long walks.\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/22/alex-soojung-kim-pang-interview-rest-why-you-get-more-done-when-you-work-less\">Here’s an interview with the author</a> in the Guardian.  That said, while\nI agree with the book’s general thesis, it’s not clear if I actually\nbenefited as much from reading this book as others. As I fine-tune this\nreview in late December 2021, three months months after I finished reading\nthis book, I’m not sure how much of the details I remember, but it could be\ndue to reading other books that convey similar themes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life</strong> ** (2018) by\nNassim Nicholas Taleb is part of his <a href=\"https://www.thriftbooks.com/series/the-black-swan/87721/\">5-book “Incerto” series</a>. I’ve only\nread this book and I might consider reading his other books. When someone has\n“Skin in the Game,” that person has something to lose.  Consider someone\nmaking a prediction about what will happen in 2022 regarding COVID. If that\nperson has to tie his or her prediction with significant financial backing\nand is thus at risk of losing money with a bad prediction, then there is\n“skin in the game,” in contrast to someone who can make an arbitrary\nprediction without being held accountable. The book is thus a tour of various\nconcepts in life that tie back to this central theme, along with resulting\n“hidden asymmetries.” For example, one reason why Taleb is so against\ninterventionism (e.g., the United States invading Iraq) is because it shows\nhow so many foreign policy pundits could safely argue for such an invasion\nwhile remaining in the comfort of their suburban homes, and thus there’s an\nasymmetry here where decisions they advocate for don’t affect them personally\ntoo much, but where they affect many others. If you can get used to Taleb’s\nidiosyncratic and pompous writing style, such as mocking people like Thomas\nL. Friedman as not a “weightlifter” and insulting Michiko Kakutani, then the\nbook might be a good fit as there’s actually some nice insights here.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Measure what Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock\nthe World with OKRs</strong> ** (2018) by famous VC <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr\">John Doerr</a> describes the\n“OKR” system which stands for “Objectives and Key Results.” Doerr is revered\nthroughout Silicon Valley and is known for mentoring Google founders Larry\nPage and Sergey Brin. I have prior experience interning at Google (remotely)\nin summer 2020, and I saw a few documents that had OKRs, though I never used\nthe system much nor did I hear much about it, but I imagine that would change\nif I ever joined Google full-time. The book covers diverse examples of\norganizations that have used OKRs (not just those in big tech), and a common\ntheme that comes up is, well, <em>work on what matters</em>.  The goal should be to\nidentify just a few key objectives that will make an impact, rather than try\nto optimize less-important things. It’s kind of an obvious point, but it’s\nalso one that doesn’t always happen. While the message is obvious, I still\nthink Doerr explains this with enough novelty to make <em>Measure what Matters</em>\na nice read. I signed up for the corresponding email subscription, and there\nis <a href=\"https://www.whatmatters.com/about-us/\">also a website</a>. Perhaps I should check those out if I have time. It\nmight be good to map out a set of OKRs for my postdoc.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Edge: Turning Adversity into Advantage</strong> (2020) by Harvard Business School\nProfessor Laura Huang, acknowledges that all of us have some adversity, but\nthat it is possible for us to turn this into something advantageous. That is\nbetter than just giving up and using adversity (e.g., “I grew up poor”) as an\nexcuse to <em>not</em> do anything. Some of her suggestions involve trying to turn\nstereotypes into your favor (e.g., redirecting what people thought of her as\nan Asian female), and to see how unexpected behavior might be useful (e.g.,\nas when she was able to get Elon Musk to talk to her).  I think her message\nseems reasonable.  I can imagine criticism from those who might think that\nthis deprioritizes the role that systematic inequality play in our society,\nbut Professor Huang makes it clear that we should <em>also</em> tackle those\ninequities <em>in addition to</em> turning adversity into advantage.  The writing is\ngood, though it sometimes reads more casually than I would expect, which I\nthink was Professor Huang’s intent. I also enjoyed learning about her\nbackground: her family’s immigration to the United States from Taiwan, and\nhow she became a faculty member at Harvard despite unexpected challenges\n(e.g., not graduating from a top PhD school with lots of papers). You can see\na video summary of the book <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEHCd0n8mc\">here</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Breaking the Silence Habit: A Practical Guide to Uncomfortable\nConversations in the #MeToo Workplace</strong> (2020) by Sarah Beaulieu, attempts to\nprovide a guideline for challenging conversations with regards to anything\nthat might be relevant to “MeToo.” She deliberately does not give firm\nanswers to questions such as “can I date a work colleague” or “should I\nreport to the manager” but emphasizes that it must be viewed in context and\nthat there are different ways one can proceed. This might sound frustrating\nbut it seems reasonable. Ultimately I don’t know if I got too much direct\nusage out of this since much of it depends on actually testing and having\nthese conversations (which, to be clear, I fully agree that we <em>should\nhave</em>), which I have not had too much opportunity to engage in myself.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Skip the Line: The 10,000 Experiments Rule and Other Surprising Advice for\nReaching Your Goals</strong> (2021), by serial entrepreneur and author James\nAltucher, uses the analogy of “skipping the line” for accelerating career\nprogress, and not necessarily having to trudge through a long list of\nhierarchies or spend 10,000 hours practicing a skill (as per Malcolm\nGladwell).  He provides a set of guidelines, such as doing 10,000\n<em>experiments</em> instead of 10,000 hours, and “idea sex” which is about trying\nto tie two ideas together to form new ones. My impression is that Altucher\ngenerally advocates for regularly engaging in (smart) risks. I won’t follow\nall of this advice, such as when he argues to avoid reading news in favor of\nbooks (see <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2021/12/22/my-information-diet/\">my information diet</a>), but I think some ideas here are worth\nconsidering for my life.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication\nOverload</strong> ** (2021) is another book by Cal Newport, and surprise surprise,\none that I also enjoy (see my prior reading lists). I would say “I don’t know\nhow he publishes all these books” but in his case, we <em>do</em> know how since the\nanswer lies in this and his past books (even if it’s not easy to implement).\nNewport’s key argument that email started off as a way to facilitate easier\ncommunication, but it soon created what he calls the “hyperactive hive mind”\nworld, characterized by being in a state of constant online presence,\nchecking email and other messaging platforms (e.g., Slack) throughout the day\n(and in the evening, and on weekends…). Newport makes a convincing case\nthat this is reducing productivity and making us miserable. For example, he\nmakes the obvious argument that a short face-to-face conversation can better\nclarify information compared to many back-and-forth emails that sap time and\nattention away from things that produce actual value. In the second part of\nthe book, he proposes principles for operating in a world without (or\nrealistically, <em>less</em>) email. I thought these were well-argued and are\nanti-technology; it’s a way of <em>better using technology</em> to create more\nfulfilling lives.  I still think I check email too much but I enjoy the days\nwhen I can simply work and program all the way, and only check email starting\naround 4:00PM or so. As usual I will try to follow this book’s advice, and I\nthink even doing this moderately will help my work habits in an increasingly\nonline world given the pandemic.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<!--\n- **The End of History and the Last Man** (1992) by Francis Fukuyama.\n  One of the most famous books of all time.\n\n  I'm reading this in 2021, when it seems like democracies are going backwards.\n\n  But, look at COVID.

A practical benefit from these studies is the\nability to identify population groups as more at risk to certain diseases to\nothers, but as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/opinion/sunday/genetics-race.html\">Reich is careful to point out</a> there’s a danger in that\nsuch studies can be exploited to nefarious means (e.g., racial stereotypes).\nI believe Reich’s justifications for working in this field make sense. If\nscientists try to avoid the question of whether there might be the <em>slightest\npossibility</em> of genetic differences among different populations, then the\nresulting void will be filled by racist and pseudo-scientific thinkers. Reich\nshows that the heavy mixture among different populations shatters beliefs\nheld by Nazis and others regarding “pure races.” Science, when properly\nunderstood, helps us better respect the diversity of humans today.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Kindred: Neanderthal Life, Love, Death and Art</strong> (2020) by Rebecca Wragg\nSykes summarizes what researchers believe about <em>Neanderthals</em>, a species\nvery closely related to <em>Homo Sapiens</em> (i.e., modern humans) who lived many\nthousands of years ago primarily in Europe and Asia.  Neanderthals captivate\nour imagination since they are so much like ourselves. In fact, interbreeding\nwas possible and did happen. But at some point, Neanderthals went extinct.\n<em>Kindred</em> reviews the cutting-edge science behind what Neanderthals were\nlike: what did they eat, how did they live, where did they migrate to, and so\non. (I was pleased to see that some of this information was also in David\nReich’s book <em>Who We Are and How We Got Here</em>.) The main takeaway I got is\nthat we should not view Neanderthals as a “less intelligent” version of\nmodern humans.  The book is a nice overview, and I am amazed that we are able\nto deduce this much from so long ago.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art</strong> (2020) by James Nestor is about\nbreathing. We all breathe, but breathing is not taught or discussed as widely\nas diet or exercise.  Nestor describes an experiment where he stuffed his\nnose and was forced to mouth-breathe for 10 days. The result?  Higher blood\npressure, worse sleep, and a host of other adverse effects.  Nestor also\ninterviews historians, scientists, and those knowledgeable about breathing,\nto learn why humans have changed breathing habits for the worse, resulting in\ncrooked teeth, worse sleep, and so on. The book concludes with some breathing\nadvice: nose breathing, chewing, holding your breath, and suggesting certain\nbreathing strategies. Written instructions for breathing can be hard to\nfollow, so <a href=\"https://www.mrjamesnestor.com/breath\">Nestor has a website</a> with more information, including videos\nand additional expert advice. I’m not sure how much I will directly benefit\nfrom this book, given that I was already a strong nose-breather, and I don’t\nbelieve I suffer from snoring or sleep apnea — any sleep issues I might\nhave are likely due to either (a) looking at too many screens (phones,\nlaptops, etc.), or (b) thinking about the state of the world while my brain\ncannot calm down. It also feels like the book might over-exaggerate\nbreathing, but to his credit, Nestor states that breathing is not going to\ncure everything.  At the very least, it was nice to see a reaffirmation of my\nbasic breathing habits, and I had not thought too much of my breathing habits\nbefore reading <em>Breath</em>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>What To Expect When You’re Expecting Robots: The Future of Human-Robot\nCollaboration</strong> ** (2020) by Laura Major and Julie Shah. The authors are\nroboticists, and I am familiar with Julie Shah’s name (she’s a Professor at\nMIT) and her research area of human-robot interaction.<sup id=\"fnref:berkeley\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:berkeley\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> This book\nfrequently refers to <em>aviation</em>, since it was one of the fields that\npioneered a balance between humans and automation (robots) in real time in a\nsafety-critical setting. In what cases does the aviation analogy hold for\nrobots interacting with humans on the ground? As compared to aviation\nsettings, there is a wider diversity of things that could happen, and we do\nnot have the luxury that aviation has with highly trained humans paired with\nthe robot (plane); we need robots that can quickly interact with everyday\npeople.  The authors present the key concept of <em>affordances</em>, or designing\nrobots so that they “make sense” to humans, similar to how we can view a\nvariety of mugs but immediately understand the function of the handle.\nThinking about other books I’ve read in the past, the one that comes closest\nto this is <em>Our Robots, Ourselves</em> where MIT Professor David Mindell\ndiscussed the history of aviation as it pertains to automation.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know</strong> (2021) is Adam\nGrant’s third book, following <em>Give and Take</em> and <em>Originals</em>, all of which I\nhave read. At a time when America seems hyper-polarized, Grant shows that it\nis possible and better for people to be willing to change their minds.\n<em>Think Again</em> is written in his usual style, which is to present a\npsychological concept and back it up with research and anecdotes. Grant cites\nthe story of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/18/daryl-davis-black-musician-who-converts-ku-klux-klan-members\">Daryl Davis</a>, a Black musician who has successfully\nconvinced dozens of former Ku Klux Klan members to abandon their prior\nbeliefs. While Grant correctly notes that it shouldn’t be the sole\nresponsibility of Black people like Davis to take the lead on something like\nthis, the point is to show that such change <em>is</em> possible.<sup id=\"fnref:sellout\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:sellout\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> Grant\nalso mentions <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harish-natarajan-4a526627/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Harish Natarajan</a>, an expert debater who effectively\nargued against a computer on a topic where he might naturally start off on\nthe weaker end (he was asked to oppose “should we have universal\npreschool?”), and how Natarajan was able to force Grant to rethink some of\nhis beliefs. Being willing to change one’s mind has, in theory, the benefit\nof flexibility in adapting to better beliefs.  Overall, I think the book was\nreasonable.  I try to assume I am open to revising beliefs, and remind myself\nthis: if I feel very strongly in favor of anything (whether it be a political\nsystem, a person, a hypothesis, and so on) then I should be prepared to\npresent a list of <em>what would cause me to change my mind</em>. Doing that might\ngo a long way to reduce tensions in today’s society.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Genius Makers: The Mavericks Who Brought AI to Google, Facebook, and\nthe World</strong> ** (2021) by journalist Cade Metz. He writes about AI, and I\nfrequently see his name floated around in articles about AI. <em>Genius Makers</em>\nis about AI and Deep Learning, and where it’s going. There are four main\nparts: the rise of Deep Learning, successes and hype (think AlphaGo), turmoil\nand dangers (bias in AI, militarization of AI, etc.), and the future.\nThroughout the book, there are stories about the key players in AI.  As\nexpected, featured players include Geoff Hinton, Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio,\nJeff Dean, Andrew Ng, and Fei-Fei Li. The key companies include Google,\nFacebook, OpenAI, Microsoft, and Baidu.  I follow AI news regularly, and the\nbook contains some Berkeley-related material, so I knew much of the books’\ncontents. Nonetheless, there was still new material. For example, I think\njust about everyone in AI these days is aware that Geoff Hinton is “The Man\nWho Didn’t Sit Down” (the title of the prologue) but I didn’t know that\nGoogle bid <em>44 million USD</em> for his startup, beating out Baidu.  While I\nreally like this book, <em>Genius Makers</em> may have overlap with other AI books\n(see my prior book reading lists for some examples) such that those who don’t\nwant to consume dozens of books about AI may prefer other options.  However,\nthis one probably contains the most information about how the key players\nhave <em>interacted</em> with each other.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"history-government-politics-economics\">History, Government, Politics, Economics</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Stamped from the Beginning: The Definitive History of Racist Ideas</strong>\n** (2016) is a massive book by historian and antiracist Ibram X. Kendi.\nThe “stamped from the beginning” term comes from former US Senator Jefferson\nDavis, who stated this in 1860 as the rationale for the inequality of whites\nand blacks. Kendi presents the history of racial inequality, with a focus on\nhow <em>racist ideas</em> have persisted in America. There are five parts, each\ncentering around a main character: Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, William\nLloyd Garrison, W.E.B. du Bois, and Angela Davis.  Throughout each chapter,\nKendi emphasizes that it was not necessarily <em>hatred of other races</em> that led\nto racism, but instead, racist thinking <em>helped to justify</em> existing racial\ndisparities. He also frequently returns to three key ideas: (1) segregationst\nthought, (2) assimilationist thought, and (3) antiracist thought. While (1)\nseems obviously racist, Kendi argues that (2) is also racist. Kendi also\npoints out inconsistencies in the way that people have treated people of\ndifferent races. For example, consider Thomas Jefferson’s hypocrisy in\ncriticizing interracial relationships, while he himself had sexual\nrelationships with his (lighter-skinned) slaves, including Sally\nHemingway.<sup id=\"fnref:american\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:american\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> More generally it raises the question of the most\nimportant phrase in the Declaration of Independence, that “all men are\ncreated equal.” It is one that I hope we will continually strive to achieve.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>How Democracies Die</strong> ** (2018) is a well-timed, chilling, concise,\nand persuasive warning of how democracies can decay into authoritarianism.\nIt’s written by Harvard Professors <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/levitsky/home\">Steven Levitsky</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/dziblatt/home\">Daniel\nZiblatt</a>, who specialize in democracies in Europe and Latin America.\nDuring the Cold War, democracies often died in the hands of military coups.\nBut nowadays, they are dying in a more subtle way: by elected officials who\nuse the system to subvert it from within. Those trends in America were\ndeveloping for years, and burst in 2016 with the election of Trump, who\nsatisfies the warning signs that Levitsky and Ziblatt argue are indicative of\nauthoritarianism: (1) weak commitment to democratic rules of the game, (2)\ndenial of the legitimacy of political opponents, (3) toleration or\nencouragement of violence, (4) readiness to curtail civil liberties of\nopponents, including media. Levitsky and Ziblatt argue that it’s not the\n<em>text</em> of the US Constitution that helped American democracy survive for\nyears, as other countries have copied the US Constitution but still decayed\ninto authoritarian rule. Rather, it’s the enforcement of democratic norms:\nmutual toleration and institutional forbearance. They review the history of\nAmerica and cite historical events showing those democratic norms in action\n(e.g., stopping FDR’s court packing attempt), but admit that the times when\ndemocratic norms appeared more robust in America were at the same times when\nthe issue of racism was de-prioritized.  They ultimately hope that a\nmulti-racial democracy can be combined with democratic norms.  The book was\nwritten in 2018, and while they didn’t directly predict the COVID-19\npandemic, which may have exacerbated some anti-democratic trends (for\nexample, by inhibiting the ability of government to function), Levitsky and\nZiblatt were on the money when it comes to some of their authoritarian\npredictors.  Trump suggesting that the election could be delayed? Yes. The\nrefusal of many politicians to accept the results of the 2020 election\n(highlighted by the insurrection of 01/06)? Yes.  <em>How Democracies Die</em>\nreminds me of <em>The Fifth Risk</em> where an equally prescient Michael Lewis wrote\nabout the dangers of what happens when people in government don’t understand\ntheir duties. A commitment to democratic norms must be considered part of an\nelected official’s duties.  I will keep this in mind and urge America towards\na more democratic future. I don’t want to live in an authoritarian country\nwhich curtails free religion, free speech, an independent media, an\nindependent judiciary, and where one man does the decision-making with\ninsufficient checks and balances.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Learning from the Germans: Race and the Memory of Evil</strong> (2019) by Susan\nNeiman, a Jewish woman, born in 1955, who has been a philosophy professor in\nthe United States and Israel, and has also lived in Germany.  I saw this\nlisted in the recommended reading references in a <em>Foreign Affairs</em> magazine.\n<em>Learning from the Germans</em> consists of (1) Germany’s history of confronting\nits Nazi past, (2) America’s history of reckoning with slavery, and (3) a\ndiscussion over monuments, reparations, and what the future may hold for\nAmerica and other countries that have to face prior sins. I learned about the\ncomplex and uneven path Germany took towards providing reparations to Jews,\nremoving Nazi memorials, and so on, with East Germany handling this process\nbetter than West Germany. Neiman believes that Germany has responded to its\npast in a better way than the United States (with respect to slavery).<sup id=\"fnref:na\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:na\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></sup>\nIt’s intriguing that many of the Germans who Neiman interviewed as part of\nher research rejected the title of the book, since they were ashamed of their\ncountry’s past, and surprised that others would want to learn from it. Neiman\nsays it’s complicated to develop “moral equivalences” between events, but\nthat ultimately what matters is how we address our past. If I were to\ncriticize something happening in country “X”, and someone from that country\nwere to respond back to me by criticizing America’s past sins, my response\nwould be simply: “yes, you’re right, America <em>has</em> been bad, <em>and</em> here is\nwhat I am doing to rectify this …”.  It’s not a contradiction to\nsimultaneously hold the following beliefs, as I do, that: (1) I enjoy living\nin America, and (2) I am very cognizant and ashamed of many historical sins\nof America’s past (and present).</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Good Economics for Hard Times</strong> ** (2019) by Nobelists Abhijit\nBanerjee and Esther Duflo, both of MIT (and a married couple); <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBGrYxWbyhg\">see the\nannouncement video</a> shortly after they won the prize. They give a\nwonderful tour of topics in economics, but also clarify that it’s not clear\nwhich policies <em>directly</em> lead to growth, as traditionally measured in GDP.\nMuch of the book emphasizes that there’s so much uncertainty in economics,\nand that given climate change, it might not be prudent to try to find the\nformula to maximize GDP. Rather, the goal should be to best address policies\nthat can serve the poor and disadvantaged.  <em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em>\nsimultaneously was a fast read but also one that felt like it got enough of\nthe technical information through to me. It’s not super likely to change the\nmind of growth-obsessed people, and it comes <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/good-economics-for-hard-times-review-sticky-markets-tricky-solutions-11574021736\">with some critique of\nTrump-style Conservatism</a>. I think it was a great book for me, and one of\nmy favorites this year.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America</strong> ** (2019) is\nby Margaret O’Mara, a Professor of History at the University of Washington\nwho researches at the intersection of technology and American politics.\nHence, she is the ideal person to write this kind of book, and I have high\ninterest in the subject area, since my research is in robotics and AI more\nbroadly, the latter of which is the topic of interest in Silicon Valley\ntoday. O’Mara starts at the end of World War II, when the leaders in tech\nwere on the East Coast near Boston and MIT. Over the next few decades, the\nSan Francisco Bay Area would develop tremendously and by the 1980s, would\nsurpass the East Coast in becoming the undisputed tech capital of the world.\nHow this happened is a remarkable story of visionaries who began tech\ncompanies, such as Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, Sergey Brin, and Larry Page\n(and Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos up north in Seattle, though all have heavy\nconnections with Silicon Valley) and venture capitalists like John Doerr.\nHowever, and perhaps this is the less interesting part, the story of Silicon\nValley is also one of sufficient government funding for both companies and\nuniversities (notably, Stanford University), along with immigration from\ntalented foreigners across the world, resulting in what O’Mara calls an\n“only-in-America story” made possible by broader political and economic\ncurrents.  O’Mara is careful to note that this prosperity was not shared\nwidely, nor could it truly be called a true meritocracy given the sexism in\nthe industry (as elaborated further in Emily Chang’s <em>Brotopia</em>) and that\nwealth went mainly to the top few white, and then Asian, men. O’Mara\nbrilliantly summarizes Silicon Valley’s recent history in a readable tome.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The World: A Brief Introduction</strong> ** (2020) is by Richard Haass,\npresident of the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/\">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, which is my go-to think\ntank for foreign affairs. I started this book and couldn’t stop myself from\nfinishing. It’s definitely on the side of <em>breadth</em> instead of <em>depth</em>.  It\nwon’t add much to those who are regular readers of <em>Foreign Affairs</em>, let\nalone foreign policy experts; Haass’  goal is to “provide the basics of what\nyou need to know about the world, to make you more globally literate.” The\nbook begins with the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648, which encoded the concept\nof the modern international system governed by countries. Obviously, it\ndidn’t end up creating permanent peace, as the world saw World War I, World\nWar II, the Cold War, and then the period after the Cold War up to today,\nwhich Haas said will later be given a common name by historians upon\nconsensus. My favorite part of the book is the second one, which covers\ndifferent regions of the world. The third part is the longest and covers\nchallenges of globalization, terrorism, nuclear proliferation, climate\nchange, and so on.  The last one is broadly titled “order and disorder.”\nWhile I knew much of the material in the book, I was still able to learn\naspects about worldwide finance and trade (among other topics) and I think\n<em>The World</em> does a valuable service in getting the reader on a good\nfoundation for subsequent understanding of the world.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"biographies--memoirs\">Biographies / Memoirs</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Shoe Dog: A Memoir by the Creator of Nike</strong> ** (2016) by Phil\nKnight, currently a billionaire and Nike cofounder, with Bill Bowerman.  Each\nchapter describes a year (1962 through 1980) in Phil Knight’s early days in\nOregon, where he co-founded Blue Ribbon Sports (later, Nike).  <em>Shoe Dog</em> —\nnamed after the phrase describing people who know shoes and footwear inside\nout — is refreshingly honest, showing the challenges Knight faced with\ngetting shoes from factories in Japan. Initially they relied on Onitsuka, but\nNike had a protracted legal challenge regarding distribution rights and\nswitched suppliers. Furthermore, Knight had a tough time securing funding and\nloans from banks, who didn’t believe that the company’s growth rate would be\nenough to pay them back. Knight eventually relied on Nissho<sup id=\"fnref:nissho\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:nissho\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup>, a\nJapanese guarantor, for funds.  Basically, the cycle was: get loan from\nNissho, make sales, pay back Nissho, and repeat.  Eventually, Nike reached a\nsize and scope comparable to Adidas and Puma, the two main competitors to\nNike at that time.  Nowadays, things have probably changed. Companies like\nUber continually lose money, but are able to get funding, so perhaps there’s\nmore of a “Venture Capitalist mentality” these days. Also, I worry if it is\nnecessary to cut corners in business to succeed.  For example, in the early\ndays, Knight lied to Onitsuka about having an office on the east coast, and\nafter signing a contract with Onitsuka, Knight had to scramble to get a\nfactory there! Things have to be different in today’s faster-paced and\nInternet-fueled world, but hopefully the spirit of entrepreneurship lives on.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood</strong> ** (2016), by\ncomedian Trevor Noah, was great. I’m aware of his work, though have never\nwatched his comedy.  He was “Born a Crime” as the son of a White (Swiss)\nfather and a Black mother, which was illegal under South Africa’s apartheid\nsystem. Noah was <em>Colored</em>, and could not be seen with his mother in many\nplaces without the risk of police catching him. I realized (though I’m sure I\nwas taught this earlier but forgot it) that in South Africa’s apartheid\nsystem, whites were actually a <em>minority</em>, but apartheid allowed whites to\nremain in control, and a key tactic was pitting different minority groups\nagainst each other, usually Blacks.<sup id=\"fnref:japan\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:japan\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup> Noah had a few advantages here,\nsince he was multi-lingual and could socialize with different minority\ngroups, and his skin color looked light on film at that time. For example,\nNoah a Black friend robbed a mall, and he was caught on video. When the\nschool principals summoned Noah, they asked him if he knew who the “white”\nguy was in the video. The person was Noah, but the administrators were\nsomehow unable to tell that, blinded by certain notions of race.  Apartheid\nformally ended during Noah’s childhood, but the consequences would and still\nare reverberating throughout South Africa.  I’m frankly amazed at what Noah\novercame to be where he is today, and also at his mother, who survived\nattempts at near murder by an ex-husband. The answer isn’t more religion and\nprayer, it’s to remove apartheid and to ensure that police listen to women\nand properly punish men who commit domestic violence.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of the Walt\nDisney Company</strong> (2019) by Robert Iger is a readable book on leadership and\nbusiness, and provides the perspective of what it is like being a CEO at a\nhuge international company. The first half describes his initial career\nbefore being CEO, and the second half is about his experience as CEO. Iger\ndescribes the stress throughout the selection stage to see who would become\nCEO after Michael Eisner, and how Iger had to balance ambition of wanting the\njob without actually demanding it outright. There was also the complexity of\nhow Iger was already a Disney insider before becoming CEO, and some wanted to\nbring in a fresh outsider. I enjoyed his view on Steve Jobs, especially after\nhaving read Walter Isaccson’s biography of Steve Jobs last year. (Jobs had a\nsometimes adversarial relationship with Disney.) It’s also nice that there’s\n“no price on integrity” (the title of Chapter 13) and that Iger is supportive\nof cracking down on sexual assault and racism. I have a few concerns, though.\nFirst, it seems like most of the “innovation” happening at Disney, at least\nwhat’s featured in the book, is based on buying companies such as Pixar and\nLucasfilm, rather than in-house development. It’s great that Iger can check\nhis ego and the company’s ego, but it’s disappointing from an innovation\nperspective. Second, while there is indeed “no price on integrity,” how far\nshould businesses acquiesce to governments who place far more restrictions on\ncivil liberties than the United States government?  Iger also repeatedly\nemphasizes how lucky he was and how important it was for others to support\nhim, but what about others who don’t have that luxury?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The Great Successor: The Divinely Perfect Destiny of Brilliant Comrade\nKim Jong Un</strong> ** (2019) by New Zealand journalist Anna Fifield. This book\nis extremely similar to the next book I’m listing here (by Jung H. Pak), so\nI’m going to combine my thoughts there.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Becoming Kim Jong Un: A Former CIA Officer’s Insights into North\nKorea’s Enigmatic Young Dictator</strong> ** (2020) by Jung H. Pak, who used to\nwork in the CIA and has since been at the Brookings Institution and in the US\nState department.  I have to confess, my original objective was to read a\nbiography of Xi Jinping. When I tried to search for one, I came across UC\nIrvine Professor <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/01/xi-jinping-china-biography/617852/\">Jeffrey Wasserstrom’s article in <em>The Atlantic</em></a> saying\nthat there <em>weren’t</em> any good biographies of Xi.<sup id=\"fnref:wasserstrom\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:wasserstrom\" rel=\"footnote\">7</a></sup> The same\narticle then said there were two biographies of Kim Jong Un, and that’s how I\nfound and read these two books. I’m glad I did!  Both do a good service in\ncovering Kim Jong Un’s life from North Korea royalty to Switzerland for\nschool, then back to North Korea to get groomed for future leadership,\nfollowed by his current leadership since 2011. I vaguely remember when he\nfirst came to power, and seeing news reports questioning whether Kim Jong Un\ntruly held power, since he was the youngest head of state at that time. But\nthe last decade has shown that Kim’s grip on power is ironclad.  There are\nonly a few differences in the topics that the books cover, and I think one of\nthem is that near the end of <em>Becoming Kim Jong Un</em>, Pak ponders about how to\ndeal with the nuclear question. She argues that rather than do a misguided\nfirst strike like John Bolton once foolishly suggested in <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-legal-case-for-striking-north-korea-first-1519862374\">a WSJ op-ed</a>\njust before he became the US National Security Advisor for former president\nTrump, we have to consider a more nuanced view of Kim and realize that he\nwill only give up nuclear weapons if maintaining them comes at too great a\ncost to bear. Since the book was published, COVID-19 happened, and if there’s\nbeen any single event that’s caused more harm to North Korea’s economy, it’s\nbeen this, as exemplified by how Russian diplomats had to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/26/asia/north-korea-trolley-russian-diplomats-intl-hnk/index.html\">leave North Korea\nby hand-pushed rail</a>. I still maintain my view that Kim Jong Un is one of\nthe worst leaders alive today, and I hope that the North Korea situation can\nimprove even a tiny bit in 2021.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"china\">China</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Factory Girls: From Village to City in a Changing China</strong> ** (2008)\nby Leslie T. Chang, who at that time was a journalist for the <em>Wall Street\nJournal</em>. I found out about this book when it was cited by Jeffrey\nWasserstrom and Maura Cunningham in their book. Chang was motivated to\nprovide an alternative perspective from a “traditional” American media, where\na lot of the focus is on dissidents and human rights (not a bad thing per se,\nbut it’s good to have balance). In this book, Chang meets and interviews\nmultiple women who came from rural areas to work in factories, particularly\nthose located in Dongguan, an industrial city in southern China in the Pearl\nRiver Delta region (a bit north of Hong Kong).  As a reporter who also could\nspeak in Mandarian, Chang is skillfully able to convey the women’s journey\nand life in a highly sympathetic manner. She does not sugarcoat the\ndifficulties of living as a factory worker; the women who she interviews have\nto work long hours, might see friendships end quickly, and have difficulties\nfinding suitable husbands in a city that has far more women than men.\n<em>Factory Girls</em> also contains Chang’s own exploration of her family history\nin China. While still interesting, my one minor comment is that I wonder if\nthis might have diluted the book’s message. Despite the 2008 publication\ndate, the book is still readable and it seems like the rural-to-urban shift\nin China is still ongoing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China</strong> ** (2011) is a\n<em>massive</em> history tome on the former Chinese leader by the great historian\nEzra F. Vogel, a long-time professor at Harvard University. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/world/asia/ezra-f-vogel-dead.html\">He passed away\nin late 2020</a>.) There likely are many other biographies of Deng and there\nmay be more in the future, but Vogel’s book is considered the “definitive”\none, and compared to later historians, Vogel will have had the advantage of\ninterviewing Deng’s direct family members and associates.  The reason for\nstudying Deng is obvious: since Deng took over the reins of China in 1978\nfollowing Mao’s death in 1976 and a brief interlude afterwards, he led\neconomic reforms that opened the world’s most populous country and helped to\nlift millions out of poverty. The bulk of the book covers Deng’s leadership\nfrom 1978 through 1992. This includes economic reforms such as the\nestablishment of “Special Economic Zones,” allowing foreign investment, and\nsending students abroad, largely to the United States, which also benefits\nfrom this relation, as <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2021/12/11/international-chinese/\">I hope my recent blogging makes clear</a>. It also\nincludes foreign affairs, such as the peaceful return of Hong Kong to China\nand the difficulties in reuniting China and Taiwan. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/world/asia/ezra-f-vogel-dead.html\">a recent NY Times\nobituary here states</a>, a criticism of Vogel’s book is that he might have\nbeen too lenient on Deng in his reporting, I do not share that criticism. In\nmy view the book presents a sufficiently comprehensive view of the good, bad,\nand questionable decisions from Deng that it’s hard for me to think of a\nharsh criticism.<sup id=\"fnref:china\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:china\" rel=\"footnote\">8</a></sup> (It is true, however, that the Chinese government\ncensored parts of this book for the Chinese translation, and <em>that</em> I\ndislike.) Vogel’s masterpiece is incredible, and I will remember it for a\nlong time.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>China Goes Global: The Partial Superpower</strong> ** (2012) is by David\nShambaugh, a professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at the\nGeorge Washington University (same department as Prof. Sean Roberts). From\nthe 1978 reforms which opened the country up to 2012, China’s been massively\ngrowing and asserting its influence on the world, but is not <em>yet</em> a\n“superpower” as would be suggested based on its population and economy. This\ncould be due to hesitancy in taking on greater international roles, as that\nmight require expensive interventions and undertakings that could hinder its\neconomic growth, which is the CCP’s main mandate to the Chinese people. One\nthing I immediately noticed: the book has the most amount of quotes,\ncitations, or interviews with Chinese government officials or academics than\nany other book I’ve read. (This was the pre-Xi era and the country was\ngenerally more open to foreigners.) Shambaugh does a great job conveying the\nwide range of opinions of the Chinese foreign policy elite. Two of the most\ncited scholars in the book are <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/experts/625\">Yan Xuetong</a> and <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/authors/wang-jisi\">Wang Jisi</a>, whose\nnames I recognized when I later read <em>Foreign Affairs</em> articles from them.\nAnother thing worth mentioning: Chinese officials have told Shambaugh that\nthey believe the “Western” media is misinformed and does not understand\nChina.  Shambaugh recalls replying, <em>what precisely</em> is the misunderstanding,\nand the government officials were aghast that there could be any\ndisagreement. In Shambaugh’s view, the media is tough but accurate on\nChina.<sup id=\"fnref:media\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:media\" rel=\"footnote\">9</a></sup> As Shambaugh emphasizes, so many people want to know <em>more</em>\nabout China (myself included, as can be obviously inferred!), and in my view\nthis means we get both the positive and the negative.  This book is a great\n(if somewhat dated) survey, and helps to boost my personal study of China.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>China Goes Green: Coercive Environmentalism for a Troubled Planet</strong> (2020)\nis co-written by professors Yifei Li and Judith Shapiro. The focus in <em>China\nGoes Green</em> is to discuss the following: in today’s era of accelerating\nclimate change (or climate <em>crisis</em>), is China’s authoritarian government\nsystem better suited to tackle environmental challenges? Some thinkers have\nposited that, while they may be sympathetic to liberal democracy and human\nrights, maybe the climate urgency of today means such debate and freedoms\nhave to be set aside in favor of “quicker” government actions by\nauthoritarian rule. Li and Shapiro challenge this line of reasoning. A\nrecurring theme is that China often projects that it wants to address climate\nchange and promote clean energy, but the policies it implements have the\nultimate goal of increasing government control over citizens while\nsimultaneously having mixed results on the actual environment.  That is,\ninstead of referring to China today as “authoritarian environmentalism”, the\nauthors argue that “environmental authoritarianism” is more accurate. The\nbook isn’t a page-turner, but it serves a useful niche in providing an\nunderstanding of how climate and government mesh in modern China.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The War on the Uyghurs: China’s Campaign Against Xinjiang’s Muslims</strong>\n** (2020) is by Sean Roberts, a professor at the Elliott School of\nInternational Affairs at the George Washington University (same department as\nProf. David Shambaugh). The Xinjiang internment camps of China have become\nhousehold names among readers of international news outlets, with reports of\ngenocide and forced labor. Roberts explains the tense history between the\nethnic Han majority in China versus the Turkic people who primarily live in\nthe rural, western areas of the country. A key part of the book is precisely\ndefining what “terrorism” means, as that has been the rationale for the\npersecution of the Uyghurs, and also other Muslim groups (including in the\nUnited States).  Roberts covers the Urumqi riots and other incidents that\ndeteriorated relations between Uyghurs and the Chinese government, and then\nthis led to what Roberts calls a “cultural genocide” that started from 2017\nand has continued today; Roberts recalled that he and other fellow academics\nstudying the subject realized something was wrong in 2017 when it became\nmassively harder to contact his colleagues from Xinjiang. One of the most\nrefreshing things (in my view) is reading this knowledge from an academic who\nhas long studied this history, instead of consuming information from\npoliticians (of both countries) who have interests in defending their\ncountry,<sup id=\"fnref:roberts\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:roberts\" rel=\"footnote\">10</a></sup> and Roberts is not shy about arguing that the United\nStates has unintentionally assisted China in its repression, particularly in\nthe designation of certain Muslim groups as “terrorism”. Of all the news that\nI’ve read in 2021, among those with an international focus, the one that\nperhaps stuck the most to my mind from 2021 is <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/the-uyghur-chronicles/\">Tahir Izgil’s chilling\nstory</a> about how he escaped the camps in Xinjiang. While this is just one\ndata point of many, I hope that in some way the international community can\ndo what it can to provide refugee status to more Uyghurs. (I am a donor to\nthe Uyghur Human Rights Project.)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"covid-19\">COVID-19</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>The Premonition: A Pandemic Story</strong> ** (2021) by Berkeley’s Michael\nLewis is the second book of his I read, after <em>The Fifth Risk</em> (published\n2018), which served as an unfortunate prologue for the American response to\nCOVID-19; I remembered <em>The Fifth Risk</em> quite well after reading <em>How\nDemocracies Die</em> earlier this year. I didn’t realize Lewis had another book\n(this one) and I devoured it as soon as I could. The US was ranked <em>number\none</em> among all countries in terms of pandemic preparation.  Let that sink in.\nBy the time it was mid-2021, the US had <em>the most recorded deaths of any\ncountry</em>.<sup id=\"fnref:recorded\"><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/feed.xml#fn:recorded\" rel=\"footnote\">11</a></sup> Lewis’ brilliance in his book, as in his others, is to\nspotlight unsung heroes, such as a California health care official and a\nformer doctor who seemed to be more competent than the United States\ngovernment or the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  Lewis is so good at\nconnecting the reader with these characters, that when reading the book, and\nseeing how they were stopped and stymied at seemingly every turn from\nsluggish government or CDC officials, I felt complete rage. (The same goes\nfor the World Health Organization, but the CDC is a US entity, so we have\nmore ability to reform it.) The biggest drawback of this book is that Lewis\ndoesn’t have any endnotes or details on how he went about investigating and\ninterviewing the people in his book. In all fairness, the officials he\ncriticizes in this book should have the opportunity to defend themselves.\nGiven the way the CDC acted early in the pandemic, though, and the number of\nrecorded deaths it would be surprising if they could mount effective\ndefenses, but again, they should have the opportunity. One more thing, I\ncan’t resist suggesting this idea: any current and future CDC director must\nhave a huge sign with these words: <strong>You must do what is right for public\nhealth.  You cannot let a politician silence or pressure you into saying what\nhe or she wants.</strong> This sign should be right at the desk of the CDC director,\nso he/she sees this on a daily basis.  Check out <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/05/03/991570372/michael-lewis-the-premonition-is-a-sweeping-indictment-of-the-cdc\">this further summary from\nNPR</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5675\">some commentary by Scott Aaronson on his blog</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>World War C: lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic and How to Prepare\nfor the Next One</strong> ** (2021) is by CNN’s chief medical correspondent Dr.\nSanjay Gupta, released in October 2021, and I expect it to reach a wide\naudience due to Dr. Gupta’s position at CNN. After a brief review of the\nearly days of the pandemic, the book covers how diseases spread, the effects\nof COVID, and the function of vaccines. Then, it provides guidelines for\nbuilding resilience to the next pandemic. For the most part, the writing here\nseems reasonable, and my main disappointment doesn’t really have to do with\nDr. Gupta per se, but has to do with how understanding the effects of\n“long-haul COVID” is just going to take a lot of time and involve a lot of\nuncertainty. Also, and this may be a good (or not so good) thing but Dr.\nGupta, while acknowledging that politics played a role in hindering the war\nagainst the pandemic (particularly in the US), tries to avoid becoming too\npolitical. His last chapter, on ensuring that humanity fights together,\nresonates with me. In April 2021, India was hit with a catastrophic COVID\nwave due to the delta variant, and at least one of Dr. Gupta’s relatives\ndied. Since the virus constantly mutates, the world essentially has to be\nvaccinated against it at once to mitigate its spread.  As the Omicron variant\nwas spreading as I finished up this book near the end of the year, it’s\nimperative that we end up supporting humans throughout the world and give out\nas many vaccines as we can, which is one reason why I consider myself a\ncitizen of the world.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"other\">Other</h1>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less</strong> (2016) by Alex Soojung-Kim\nPang, emphasizes the need for rest and recovery to improve productivity. This\nseems obvious. I mean, can you <em>really</em> work 16 hours a day with maximum\nenergy? Pang argues that it’s less common for people to think about\n“optimizing” their rest as opposed to things more directly related to\nproductivity. As he laments: “we think of rest as simply the absence of work,\nnot as something that stands on its own or has its own qualities.” The book\npresents anecdotes and studies about how some of the most creative and\naccomplished people (such as Charles Darwin) were able to do what they did in\nlarge part due to rest, or taking breaks such as engaging in long walks.\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/22/alex-soojung-kim-pang-interview-rest-why-you-get-more-done-when-you-work-less\">Here’s an interview with the author</a> in the Guardian.  That said, while\nI agree with the book’s general thesis, it’s not clear if I actually\nbenefited as much from reading this book as others. As I fine-tune this\nreview in late December 2021, three months months after I finished reading\nthis book, I’m not sure how much of the details I remember, but it could be\ndue to reading other books that convey similar themes.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life</strong> ** (2018) by\nNassim Nicholas Taleb is part of his <a href=\"https://www.thriftbooks.com/series/the-black-swan/87721/\">5-book “Incerto” series</a>. I’ve only\nread this book and I might consider reading his other books. When someone has\n“Skin in the Game,” that person has something to lose.  Consider someone\nmaking a prediction about what will happen in 2022 regarding COVID. If that\nperson has to tie his or her prediction with significant financial backing\nand is thus at risk of losing money with a bad prediction, then there is\n“skin in the game,” in contrast to someone who can make an arbitrary\nprediction without being held accountable. The book is thus a tour of various\nconcepts in life that tie back to this central theme, along with resulting\n“hidden asymmetries.” For example, one reason why Taleb is so against\ninterventionism (e.g., the United States invading Iraq) is because it shows\nhow so many foreign policy pundits could safely argue for such an invasion\nwhile remaining in the comfort of their suburban homes, and thus there’s an\nasymmetry here where decisions they advocate for don’t affect them personally\ntoo much, but where they affect many others. If you can get used to Taleb’s\nidiosyncratic and pompous writing style, such as mocking people like Thomas\nL. Friedman as not a “weightlifter” and insulting Michiko Kakutani, then the\nbook might be a good fit as there’s actually some nice insights here.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>Measure what Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock\nthe World with OKRs</strong> ** (2018) by famous VC <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr\">John Doerr</a> describes the\n“OKR” system which stands for “Objectives and Key Results.” Doerr is revered\nthroughout Silicon Valley and is known for mentoring Google founders Larry\nPage and Sergey Brin. I have prior experience interning at Google (remotely)\nin summer 2020, and I saw a few documents that had OKRs, though I never used\nthe system much nor did I hear much about it, but I imagine that would change\nif I ever joined Google full-time. The book covers diverse examples of\norganizations that have used OKRs (not just those in big tech), and a common\ntheme that comes up is, well, <em>work on what matters</em>.  The goal should be to\nidentify just a few key objectives that will make an impact, rather than try\nto optimize less-important things. It’s kind of an obvious point, but it’s\nalso one that doesn’t always happen. While the message is obvious, I still\nthink Doerr explains this with enough novelty to make <em>Measure what Matters</em>\na nice read. I signed up for the corresponding email subscription, and there\nis <a href=\"https://www.whatmatters.com/about-us/\">also a website</a>. Perhaps I should check those out if I have time. It\nmight be good to map out a set of OKRs for my postdoc.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Edge: Turning Adversity into Advantage</strong> (2020) by Harvard Business School\nProfessor Laura Huang, acknowledges that all of us have some adversity, but\nthat it is possible for us to turn this into something advantageous. That is\nbetter than just giving up and using adversity (e.g., “I grew up poor”) as an\nexcuse to <em>not</em> do anything. Some of her suggestions involve trying to turn\nstereotypes into your favor (e.g., redirecting what people thought of her as\nan Asian female), and to see how unexpected behavior might be useful (e.g.,\nas when she was able to get Elon Musk to talk to her).  I think her message\nseems reasonable.  I can imagine criticism from those who might think that\nthis deprioritizes the role that systematic inequality play in our society,\nbut Professor Huang makes it clear that we should <em>also</em> tackle those\ninequities <em>in addition to</em> turning adversity into advantage.  The writing is\ngood, though it sometimes reads more casually than I would expect, which I\nthink was Professor Huang’s intent. I also enjoyed learning about her\nbackground: her family’s immigration to the United States from Taiwan, and\nhow she became a faculty member at Harvard despite unexpected challenges\n(e.g., not graduating from a top PhD school with lots of papers). You can see\na video summary of the book <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbEHCd0n8mc\">here</a>.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Breaking the Silence Habit: A Practical Guide to Uncomfortable\nConversations in the #MeToo Workplace</strong> (2020) by Sarah Beaulieu, attempts to\nprovide a guideline for challenging conversations with regards to anything\nthat might be relevant to “MeToo.” She deliberately does not give firm\nanswers to questions such as “can I date a work colleague” or “should I\nreport to the manager” but emphasizes that it must be viewed in context and\nthat there are different ways one can proceed. This might sound frustrating\nbut it seems reasonable. Ultimately I don’t know if I got too much direct\nusage out of this since much of it depends on actually testing and having\nthese conversations (which, to be clear, I fully agree that we <em>should\nhave</em>), which I have not had too much opportunity to engage in myself.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Skip the Line: The 10,000 Experiments Rule and Other Surprising Advice for\nReaching Your Goals</strong> (2021), by serial entrepreneur and author James\nAltucher, uses the analogy of “skipping the line” for accelerating career\nprogress, and not necessarily having to trudge through a long list of\nhierarchies or spend 10,000 hours practicing a skill (as per Malcolm\nGladwell).  He provides a set of guidelines, such as doing 10,000\n<em>experiments</em> instead of 10,000 hours, and “idea sex” which is about trying\nto tie two ideas together to form new ones. My impression is that Altucher\ngenerally advocates for regularly engaging in (smart) risks. I won’t follow\nall of this advice, such as when he argues to avoid reading news in favor of\nbooks (see <a href=\"https://danieltakeshi.github.io/2021/12/22/my-information-diet/\">my information diet</a>), but I think some ideas here are worth\nconsidering for my life.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>** <strong>A World Without Email: Reimagining Work in an Age of Communication\nOverload</strong> ** (2021) is another book by Cal Newport, and surprise surprise,\none that I also enjoy (see my prior reading lists). I would say “I don’t know\nhow he publishes all these books” but in his case, we <em>do</em> know how since the\nanswer lies in this and his past books (even if it’s not easy to implement).\nNewport’s key argument that email started off as a way to facilitate easier\ncommunication, but it soon created what he calls the “hyperactive hive mind”\nworld, characterized by being in a state of constant online presence,\nchecking email and other messaging platforms (e.g., Slack) throughout the day\n(and in the evening, and on weekends…). Newport makes a convincing case\nthat this is reducing productivity and making us miserable. For example, he\nmakes the obvious argument that a short face-to-face conversation can better\nclarify information compared to many back-and-forth emails that sap time and\nattention away from things that produce actual value. In the second part of\nthe book, he proposes principles for operating in a world without (or\nrealistically, <em>less</em>) email. I thought these were well-argued and are\nanti-technology; it’s a way of <em>better using technology</em> to create more\nfulfilling lives.  I still think I check email too much but I enjoy the days\nwhen I can simply work and program all the way, and only check email starting\naround 4:00PM or so. As usual I will try to follow this book’s advice, and I\nthink even doing this moderately will help my work habits in an increasingly\nonline world given the pandemic.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<!--\n- **The End of History and the Last Man** (1992) by Francis Fukuyama.\n  One of the most famous books of all time.\n\n  I'm reading this in 2021, when it seems like democracies are going backwards.\n\n  But, look at COVID.
