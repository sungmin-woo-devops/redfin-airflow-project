They emphasized two critical points: first, never share proprietary information with an open AI tool; and second, always be transparent when using AI, just as you would with a bibliography or by naming your sources. This transparency is essential for maintaining trust and integrity in how AI is integrated into professional practices.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uzW2Vpx493TWg8-j2RsBwA.png\" /></figure><h4>Try the beta version of John Smith GPT <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/g/g-cO9YeBt62-john-smith-gpt\">here</a>. The custom AI:</h4><blockquote>Leverages decades of civil engineering knowledge from veteran civil engineer John Oliver Smith.</blockquote><blockquote>Provides information on materials relevant to grant projects, enhancing proposal detail.</blockquote><blockquote>Supplies data on eco-friendly materials and methods, supporting sustainability objectives.</blockquote><p>John Smith also underscored the importance of not sharing confidential information with AI systems. He likened AI to a powerful tool that, like any other, needs to be used responsibly. Moreover, he encouraged attendees to pilot AI tools with their teams before full-scale implementation, allowing for collaborative input and refinement of the technology to suit specific needs. Their message was clear: AI can transform the industry, but it must be used thoughtfully and with full awareness of its ethical implications.</p><p>As AI tools continue to develop, sessions like <a href=\"https://nebula.wsimg.com/a752b859406b57bc34e23b17afbc1017?AccessKeyId=68A96AC5927D48C451ED&amp;disposition=0&amp;alloworigin=1\">this at TriCon</a> are essential for staying informed and prepared.

Additionally, you can control the similarity-threshold to account for a match, and the minimum resolution required for a face to be considered.</p><p>The script loads the query face, computes its embedding and then proceeds to load all images in the target directory and compute embeddings for all found faces. Cosine similarity is then used to compare each found face with the query face. A match is recorded if the similarity score is greater than the provided threshold.

The leap from iPhone to AI-Phone paints a picture of a future where our devices aren’t just tools but partners capable of anticipating our needs and actions. Yet, amidst this enthusiastic anticipation, it’s crucial to examine the potential pitfalls that might cause Apple Intelligence to fall short of these lofty expectations.</p><h3>Technological Overreach?</h3><p>The very ambition that makes Apple Intelligence seem revolutionary could also be its Achilles’ heel. Apple plans to seamlessly integrate advanced AI across its suite of devices, promising an ecosystem where your iPad, iPhone, and Mac work together more intelligently than ever. However, the complexity of implementing such deep, cross-platform integration without glitches, privacy issues, or user frustration is immense. Could Apple be promising more than current technology realistically allows?</p><h3>The Privacy Paradox</h3><p>Apple has long championed privacy as a cornerstone of its brand, yet the increased data processing required by Apple Intelligence could strain this commitment. With features like real-time language and image processing touted, the volume of data analyzed by AI will be vast. Even with promises of on-device processing, the potential for privacy breaches grows as more personal information is constantly analyzed by AI. Will Apple manage to uphold its privacy standards, or will the allure of AI functionality tempt it to compromise?</p><h3>User Experience and Learning Curve</h3><p>Another potential shortfall could be in the user experience. Apple Intelligence introduces a slew of advanced functionalities — from smarter Siri interactions to complex image editing tools. While these advancements are impressive, they also introduce a steep learning curve. Not all users are ready for such sophistication from their devices. The risk? Apple could alienate users who prefer simplicity and reliability over cutting-edge features.</p><h3>Potential for Disruption vs. Practical Utility</h3><p>Another area where Apple Intelligence could disappoint is the gap between potential and utility. The tech showcased, like using AI for predictive text or advanced photo editing, is undoubtedly forward-thinking. However, if these features don’t translate into tangible improvements in daily use or if they come off as gimmicky rather than genuinely useful, user adoption may lag. Apple’s challenge is to ensure that Apple Intelligence feels essential, not just impressive.</p><h3>The Compatibility Conundrum</h3><p>Lastly, Apple Intelligence will initially only be available on the latest devices equipped with the newest chips. This limitation means that a significant portion of Apple’s user base won’t have immediate access to these features. Limiting cutting-edge capabilities to high-end models could frustrate users who are unable or unwilling to upgrade, potentially slowing down widespread adoption.</p><h3>Conclusion: A Cautious Approach</h3><p>As we edge into the AI-Phone era, it’s evident that Apple Intelligence could significantly shift how we interact with our devices. Yet, this new frontier is fraught with challenges that could hinder Apple’s vision from fully materializing. Users, analysts, and enthusiasts should temper their expectations with a healthy dose of skepticism, focusing on the practical implementation rather than the promised revolution.</p><h4>Check out our full analysis <a href=\"https://www.prescouter.com/2024/07/apple-intelligence-new-ai-features-iphone-ipad-mac/\">here</a> for more information about Apple Intelligence and how it will integrate generative AI into the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.</h4><img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=6420a910253a\" width=\"1\" /><hr /><p><a href=\"https://becominghuman.ai/why-apple-intelligence-might-fall-short-of-expectations-6420a910253a\">Why Apple Intelligence Might Fall Short of Expectations?</a> was originally published in <a href=\"https://becominghuman.ai\">Becoming Human: Artificial Intelligence Magazine</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>"
